# Vitae
... is a feature-rich blog theme for Hugo that **focuses on your content**.

## :mega: Version 3 is finally released!

The development of version 3 is finished. Currently I'm in the process of
planning how to proceed with the development of the theme. For the moment I'll
mainly fix bugs and refactor program code.
