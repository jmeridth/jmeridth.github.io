Joe's post reminded me of something that I heard while at the ALT.net conference.  While attending the MonoRail session, the developers were talking about which view engine to use and the topic of Boo and Brail came about.  When that was mentioned a few guys stated that they wanted to learn Boo but couldn't see themselves switching from C# or VB.NET to a new language.
