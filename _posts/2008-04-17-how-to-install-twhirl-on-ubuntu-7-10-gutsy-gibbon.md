_**Update**: I jumped the gun and I thought I'd never have to say this about Linux, but you may have to reboot after the install.  I lost atitle bars on all windows after the install.  After reboot, they came back.  Glad I didn't have to go down that rabbit hole._ 

Get the new Adobe Air (Alpha) download for Linux from [here.](http://labs.adobe.com/technologies/air/)

Go to where you downloaded it and type the following, to install it:

chmod +x  adobeair_linux_a1_033108.bin  
./adobeair_linux_a1_033108.bin

Go download Twhirl from [here:](http://www.twhirl.org/project/twhirl)

I let the adobe air installer take it and let it install in the suggested folder (in case there are any dependencies on the air libraries that I don't know of).

Last install screen will ask you if you want to start Twhirl up.  Do it!  Enjoy!!  
  
I'll update this post if I have any issues.

**[Tom](#225 "2008-05-06 01:59:08"):** Thanks for the quick and easy instructions. If you want to update, this install also works in Ubuntu 8.04 Hardy Heron and with Twhirl ver. 0.8. Couldn't get ver. 1.0 to download into Linux though.

**[Tom](#226 "2008-05-06 02:02:26"):** Also, you can right click on the Adobe Air file, select properties, permissions and check the box next to Allow Executing File as Program (as it says on the Air download page). And instead of running the code, drag the file into a Terminal window to start the installation.
