I have started using [Pidgin](http://www.pidgin.im/) instant messaging.  It consolidates my Google Talk, MSN Messenger, and Yahoo Accounts.  I've used [Trillian](http://www.ceruleanstudios.com/) in the past with success but it doesn't include Google Talk.  I also have [Skype](http://www.skype.com/) for voice messaging.  I hope Pidgin can include that someday.

What does everyone else use?

**[Garo Yeriazarian](#166 "2007-10-24 13:55:29"):** I use Pidgin as well, I've been using it since it was called Gaim.

**[Chris Patterson](#167 "2007-10-24 14:34:26"):** I use Adium and Skype. It sure would be nice if Skype was more open to integrate with Adium but I guess that is why Skype works almost everywhere - even places that block most regular im clients.

**[Jason Meridth](#168 "2007-10-24 15:09:00"):** I love Pidgin because it works in Ubuntu (Linux) also. :) I forgot that Pidgin was the Gaim rename. @Chris, I'll have to check out Adium. Thanks.

**[Scott Bellware](#169 "2007-10-24 19:13:21"):** I use GTalk through Trillian...
