For those fellow Facebook users out there there is a slim chance that [it might be shutdown](http://www.pcworld.com/article/id,135041-c,webservices/article.html).  It looks like Mark Zuckerberg, the founder of Facebook may have potential taken the code from a codebase he was working on with some Harvard students for the [ConnectU](http://www.connectu.com/) project.

I've seen the MySpace craze, and the newly famous (at least to me) Twitter website.  So for anyone who reads this, if my Facebook account gets shutdown, what other "connecting" websites do you suggest?
