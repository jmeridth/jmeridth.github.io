Anyone in the Oklahoma City area on July 28th should check out the OCDG Code Camp.  The group has a lunch meeting and evening meeting every month. 

The group's website is [here](http://www.okcpro.net/). 

The code camp website is [here](http://www.okcodecamp.com/).

The agenda includes speakers like Jeremy Miller, Jean-Paul Boodhoo, and Scott Bellware.

I had no plans to attend, and was just trying to get the word out, but after reading the speaker list, I'm most definately going.  I've wanted to meet Jean-Paul Boodhoo and Jeremy Miller for a while now.

I've already had the pleasure of meeting Scott and I will be seeing him again tomorrow after the Austin .NET Users group meeting (if we go to Rudy's as usual).

Look forward to seeing anyone else who decides to attend.
