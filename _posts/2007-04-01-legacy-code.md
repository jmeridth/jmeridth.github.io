I recently read Jeremy Miller's [post](http://codebetter.com/blogs/jeremy.miller/archive/2007/04/01/Removing-the-_2200_Legacy_2200_-from-your-Code.aspx) on his thoughts about Legacy Code.Â  His expanded definition of Legacy code was perfect:  


###### **Legacy code is code that you're afraid of**, but is too valuable or big to toss away. 

He comments on Michael Feathers and how his book "[Working Effectively with Legacy Code](http://www.amazon.com/Working-Effectively-Legacy-Robert-Martin/dp/0131177052)" is a pillar of knowledge in regards to Legacy Code and how to approach/handle it; you can [Start here](http://www.objectmentor.com/resources/articles/WorkingEffectivelyWithLegacyCode.pdf). 

I'm not going to repeat everything Jeremy states, so go read his [blog entry](http://codebetter.com/blogs/jeremy.miller/archive/2007/04/01/Removing-the-_2200_Legacy_2200_-from-your-Code.aspx).
