For those developers who can't design very well (like myself), here is a link to a free design site:

[OpenWebDesign.com](http://www.openwebdesign.org/)

[OpenSourceWebDesign.com (Older Version, More templates)  
](http://www.oswd.org/)

The popular list has some good ones and they are mainly CSS driven layouts.Â  Very cool.
