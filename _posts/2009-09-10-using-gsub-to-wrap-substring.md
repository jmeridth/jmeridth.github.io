Over my lunch today I finally had an opportunity to use something I learned yesterday reading Dan Croak's ["gsub with a block"](http://robots.thoughtbot.com/post/183070874/gsub-with-a-block) post on [the Thoughtbot blog](http://robots.thoughtbot.com).

I use the twitter gem and just display my last status on my personal homepage at [JasonMeridth.com](http://jasonmeridth.com). I didn't want to hand out my username and password so all I do is encapsulate the twitter piece in a module called TwitterHelper and put it into my app/helpers/ folder in my Rails application:
    
    
    require 'twitter'
    require 'pp'
    
    module TwitterHelper  
      def latest_twitter_status(user_id='armmer')
        begin
          status = Twitter.user(user_id).status['text']
          status ||= ''
          status = status.gsub(/http://(.+?)s/) do |url|
            " <a href='#{url}' target='_blank'>#{url}</a> "
          end
        rescue Exception => e
          logger.info("Twitter Helper Exception: " + e)
          status = ""
        end
      end
    end
    

and then in my view I just call:
    
    
    latest_twitter_status
    

The important part of code to look at is:
    
    
    status = status.gsub(/(http://.*)/) do |url|
      " <a href='#{url}' target='_blank'>#{url}</a> "
    end
    

This code will wrap any strings that start with http:// with an html href.
