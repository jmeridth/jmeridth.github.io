I'm currently studying up on the [Castle Project](http://www.castleproject.org/).  It is currently scheduled for release in January of 2007, but the public API code is pretty much complete; it won't change.

There is a good article on [InfoWorld](http://www.infoworld.com/article/06/11/21/HNcastleproject_1.html) and I've found 2 others on CodeProject ([1](http://www.codeproject.com/cs/design/introducingcastle.asp) | [2](http://www.codeproject.com/cs/design/introducingcastleii.asp)).  The second one from CodeProject talks about Castle on Rails.  I believe this is now called [MonoRail](http://www.castleproject.org/monorail/index.html), mimicing the [Ruby on Rails](http://www.rubyonrails.org/) Framework.  The article made it look VERY easy to setup a website with Monorail.  A co-worker recently mentioned he would try to setup a new site with the tool and see how it works out.  I may just do the same thing.

If you are not familiar with Inversion of Control, the first article from [CodeProject](http://www.codeproject.com/) and a recent article from [MSDN](http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa973811.aspx) are worth the read.  They highlight usage of the [Windsor Container](http://www.castleproject.org/container/index.html), the IoC control from the Castle Project.
