Read the following [blog entry](http://davidhayden.com/blog/dave/archive/2005/11/05/2556.aspx) from [David Hayden](http://www.davidhayden.com/davidhayden/default.aspx).Â  This teaches you how to update the class template that Visual Studio 2005 uses to create new classes.

I know this is old, but it seems to come up a lot as a pet-peeve of friends and colleagues.

Hope this helps someone.

**[Jason Meridth](#86 "2007-09-13 01:12:56"):** I still communicate with newbies who won't purchase ReSharper and still code in VB.NET. This is for them. I completely agree with you though. When are you going to Simpsonize your photo? We will cordially do it for you. :)
