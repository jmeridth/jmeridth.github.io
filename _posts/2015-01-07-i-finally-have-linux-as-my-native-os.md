I finally replaced OSX on my Mac with Ubuntu 14.04 LTS.  Out of the box I've had no issues.  Wireless, VPN, Terminal, Dropbox, Google Drive, LastPass, etc all work.  I was spending more time in my [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/) VMs with OSX anyway.  Loved [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/) + Vagrant.  Never had an issue.  I just wasn't using any portion of OSX.  It is nice to troubleshoot any issues and tweak my setup.  I'm getting used to Unity and may drop it for Gnome3 and Gnome-Do.  We'll see.  Any new things I troubleshoot or find, I'll post on.
