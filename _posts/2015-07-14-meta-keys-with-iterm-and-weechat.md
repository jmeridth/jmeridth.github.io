Found [this][1] tip today about how to ensure your iTerm console sends `+Esc` to weechat for the meta keys to work properly.

> To make alt key bindings behave well for Mac OS X iTerm2, go to Preferences->Profiles->Keys and click +Esc radio button for option keys.

I like to use meta+c to clear a buffer and meta+x to close a buffer.  meta for me is the `Alt` key.  [Here][2] is the keybindings in my `.weechat.conf`.
