I recently became aware of using the `<details></details>` and `<summary>...</summary>` tags in Github issues and Gists.

[Here](https://github.com/jmeridth/jmeridth.github.io/issues/3) is an example.

I will definitely be using this more when posting big logs or stack traces.

Kudos:

  - [Matt Hinze](https://twitter.com/mhinze) for showing me [this](https://gist.github.com/ericclemmons/b146fe5da72ca1f706b2ef72a20ac39d) gist where I learned of `<summary>...</summary>`
  - [Eric Clemmons](https://twitter.com/ericclemmons) for the awesome [gist](https://gist.github.com/ericclemmons/b146fe5da72ca1f706b2ef72a20ac39d) that does a great job explaining the feature
