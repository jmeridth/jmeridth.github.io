**Edit**:  After fighting with Raspbian Lite, I decided to use HypriotOS as the base image on my Raspberry Pis.  Here are the [downloads](https://blog.hypriot.com/downloads/).  I used version 1.9.0 that included Docker 18.04.0-ce, kernel 4.14.34.  You can still use Etcher below to put the image on the SD Cards

Howdy again.

Alright, my 8 port switch showed up so I was able to connect my raspberry 3B+ boards to my home network.  I plugged it in with 6 1ft CAT5 cables I had in my catch-all box that all of us nerds have.  I'd highly suggest flexible CAT 6 cables instead if you can get them, like [here](https://www.amazon.com/Cat-Ethernet-Cable-Black-Connectors/dp/B01IQWGKQ6).   I ordered them and they showed up before I finished this post, so I am using the CAT6 cables.

The IP addresses they will receive initialy from my home router via DHCP can be determined with nmap.  Lets imagine my subnet is 192.168.1.0/24.

Once I got them on the network I did the following:

```bash
[master]->$ nmap -sn 192.168.1.0/24 | grep raspberrypi
Nmap scan report for raspberrypi (192.168.1.95)
Nmap scan report for raspberrypi (192.168.1.100)
Nmap scan report for raspberrypi (192.168.1.102)
Nmap scan report for raspberrypi (192.168.1.114)
Nmap scan report for raspberrypi (192.168.1.115)
Nmap scan report for raspberrypi (192.168.1.117)
```

### Install Raspbian OS On SD Cards

You can get the Raspberry Pi Stretch Lite OS from [here](https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/raspbian/).

Then use the [Etcher](https://etcher.io/) tool to install it to each of the 6 SD cards.

#### IMPORTANT

Before putting the cards into the Raspberry Pis you need to add a `ssh` folder to the root of the SD cards.  This will allow you to ssh to each Raspberry Pi with default credentials (username: `pi` and password `raspberry`).  Example: `ssh pi@raspberry_pi_ip` where `raspberry_pi_ip` is obtained from the nmap command above.

Next post will be setting up kubernetes.  Thank you for reading.

Cheers.
