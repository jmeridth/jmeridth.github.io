A few of my posts lately have been non-technical, and this one is following suit, hence the OT (Off Topic) prefix on the post.  If you play video games, via console or PC/MAC, please take a moment and check out the [Child's Play Charity](http://www.childsplaycharity.org).  It is a merging between gamers of the world and the hospitals of the world.  What it consists of, is the ability to choose a registered hospital, listed on a map:

(on the homepage of the site), and choose a toy from amazon to send to the hospital for children at the hospital.  You can also make a monetary donation via [PayPal](https://www.paypal.com/xclick/business=childsplaycharity@penny-arcade.com&item_name=Childs%2BPlay%2BCharity&no_note=1&tax=0&currency_code=USD).  They have a goal of $750K for the charity.  They are around $460K.  Any help you can give will bring a smile to a child's face and show the world that gamers give back too. 

Thank you to [Matt Dietz](http://www.twitter.com/cerberus98) for making me aware of this charity.
