In response to Joe Ocampo's (AgileJoe) [question](http://www.lostechies.com/blogs/joe_ocampo/archive/2007/10/20/curious-what-does-your-day-look-like.aspx):

My typical day. 

  * 5:30 Wake-up 
  * 5:45 Wake-up wife, start taking care of son
  * 5:45-7:00 Feed him, smile when he gives me his morning "present" (a doody diaper), and change him 
  * 7:00 Take him to daycare 
  * 7:30 Get to work 
  * Throughout business day I catch up on blog posts ([my Google reader shared items](http://www.google.com/reader/shared/10911683354881063158)) and write some of my own drafts while waiting for our 6,000+ unit test suite to run.  I also check email to answer [AlamoCoders](http://www.alamocoders.net/) or non-posting questions for LosTechies.  I work with my wife, so I usually have lunch with her. 
  * 5:00PM Leave, pick up son from daycare 
  * 5:30 Feed and spend time with family 
  * 6:30-7:00 Bathe and take son to bed 
  * 7:00 Code or write blog entries (I get 3 hours and possibly more after I spend time with wife] 
  * 10:00-12:00 Spend time with wife and go to bed (this can change if I have presentation or commitment)

The 2nd week of the month is the [AlamoCoders](http://www.alamocoders.net/) monthly meeting, so it is pretty hectic.

The last 2 months I've done the [DevCares](http://www.devcares.com) session in San Antonio also.

This following week is especially hectic:  
Top things to do:

1\. Figure out why my CI server is not liking my "get latest" from [svnrepository.com](http://www.svnrepository.com) (it's something I'm doing, not svnrepository.com)  
2\. Ensure that all the guys on the team I'm on have access to the new SVN repository I created for our MonoRail sessions next week.  
3\. Grok [NHibernate](http://www.nhibernate.org)  
4\. Finish reading "[Herding Cats](http://www.google.com/reader/shared/10911683354881063158)" - EXCELLENT book so far.  
5\. Finish (the never ending task) and grok [DDD book.](http://www.amazon.com/Domain-Driven-Design-Tackling-Complexity-Software/dp/0321125215)  
6\. Prepare for LINQ DevCares (If you're in San Antonio, [sign-up here](https://www.clicktoattend.com/invitation.aspx?code=121286), It's FREE)  
etc.
