**Precursor: My MonoRail posts will continue soon, but I'm moving my office and have also had the "tech support" calls from friends and family lately, hence the OS, hardware posts.  We all have to do this stuff at sometime, right?  The services and CC.NET posts were because I'm managing our web server.

My next door neighbor's computer crashed.  As as we all know, if you are in the industry, you are a tech support person by default.

This post is for anyone googling about how to remove a hard drive from the Dell Dimension 3000:

I googled and found nothing.  I resorted to the [online documentation](http://support.dell.com/support/edocs/systems/dim3000/en/SM/parts.htm) and Dell actually had it there.  A hard drive is a hard drive, but when you open this case you can see the 4 screws you need to remove and also the power button cord you need to disconnect from the motherboard and it still won't remove the bay, you start to wonder.  What you don't see is something I would have never guessed or found if I had not looked at the manual:

Notice the screw on the bottom?  That was why I couldn't remove the bay.  Maybe this is my first hard drive bay like this, but it was interesting.

**[junaid](#150 "2008-11-15 12:05:42"):** you dont need a boot cd for this computer , when the computer starts on the first loading screen where it says press f12 for boot menu and f2 for something else , press left ctrl and f11 (both buttons at the same time) and it will let you format the computer and it has windows xp software built so you install that aswell you can upgrade to vista later if you wish. hope that helps
