**[jlockwood](#96 "2007-09-18 17:55:19"):** That's a way cool link! I love Feathers and Meyers! Stroustrup gave some dry reading on the other hand...who's Joshua Bloch. Just kidding...word to all you Java types out there!

**[Jason Meridth](#97 "2007-09-18 19:48:08"):** For all who don't know, Joshua Bloch practically wrote the collections libraries in Java and also the Effective Java book. He is working for Google now. Nice pic Josh.
