You think it's getting hit a little hard?

**[Chad Myers](#208 "2007-11-15 14:03:29"):** Oh good, it's not just me that was seeing that. Whelp, I guess that's another reason to move it off of Yahoo and onto Google. I'm guessing Google isn't as restrictive.

**[Chris Patterson](#209 "2007-11-15 14:37:03"):** Scott tried to set it up on Google first and they denied it. Then Palermo setup the Yahoo group and got it up and running before ALT.NET in Austin ended (tear). I wonder if Yahoo allows you to upgrade a group to something bigger -- although I would not miss having to deal with the Yahoo interface. I do think a lot of steam has built up in that group and it would be a shame to have to move it so suddenly.
