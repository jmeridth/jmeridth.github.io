One of the first things I should have posted:  [How It Works](http://www.castleproject.org/monorail/documentation/trunk/manual/howitworks.html)

This will help us when we go to the next post on layouts (view engines).

Instead of starting on the page, it starts with the controller as a true MVC architecture should.
