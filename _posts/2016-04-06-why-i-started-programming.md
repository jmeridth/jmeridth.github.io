I've been interviewing a lot lately since I was let go from my last gig.  During the interviews I've been asked a few times when and why I started programming.  My answer is the following:

- I wrote my first program in the Basic programming language when I was eight years old (1988) and loved that I could control a computer and build software.
- In 1991 when QBasic came out I learned about the [easter egg][1] that you can do when starting QBasic from a DOC prompt.  The easter egg showed "The Team of Programmers" that created QBasic.  Once I saw that, I told myself I wanted to be one of them.

- The idea of learning another business industry so I could create software for them excited me.  Here are some of the industries I've learned through my career:
  - Banking
  - Oil &amp; Gas
  - Hosting
  - Medical
  - Daycare
  - Salon
  - Restaurant/Service
  - E-Commerce
  - Sports Merchandise
  - Home Security
