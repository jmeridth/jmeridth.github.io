I just got a new laptop.  It is a Lenovo Thinkpad X1 Carbon 5th Gen.

Ubuntu 17.10
16 GB RAM
1 TB SSD
64-bit i7 Pentium
USB-C power

I'm in love.

My only gripe is that the `Fn` key is on the far left bottom of the keyboard. I prefer that to be the `Ctrl` key due to copy/paste and other keyboard commands I use often.  I also have very big hands and my pinky isn't made to "find" the `Ctrl` key to the right of the `Fn` key.

I currently use `Dconf` for mapping of keys in Ubuntu (currently using 17.10).  I learned today that the `fn` key on keyboards is not managed by the operating system, which makes sense.  Lenovo in all of its glorious-ness has a BIOS option to swap the `Fn` and `Ctrl` keys.

Thank you Lenovo.

Cheers.
