For individuals who do not like command prompt, you can use a GUI tool to handle your NAnt build files.  This was mentioned on the [Alt.NET yahoo group](http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/altnetconf/). Check it out [here](http://nantgui.berlios.de/).  I just played with it briefly and it does it's job.  You are able to also run the build file while in the UI and see the output.  I'm a command-line guy so, I will probably be using for educating other developers on NAnt.  It's a good starting point.  It will get people up and running fast.

**_NOTE_**: If you are going to .NET 2.0 related items with your build file, you need to edit the config file (NAnt-Gui.exe.config) in the <Location You Downloaded the tool>bin folder.  Look at the very bottom of the file and un-comment the 2.0 runtime lines (just like the NAnt.config files too):  
  

    
    
       1: <startup>            
    
    
       2:         <!-- .NET Framework 2.0 -->
    
    
       3:         <supportedRuntime version="v2.0.50727" />  <!-- The line I needed -->
    
    
       4:         <!-- .NET Framework 2.0 Beta 2 -->
    
    
       5:         <supportedRuntime version="v2.0.50215" /> 
    
    
       6:         <!-- .NET Framework 2.0 Beta 1 -->
    
    
       7:         <supportedRuntime version="v2.0.40607" /> 
    
    
       8:         <!-- .NET Framework 1.1 -->
    
    
       9:         <supportedRuntime version="v1.1.4322" />
    
    
      10:         <!-- .NET Framework 1.0 -->
    
    
      11:         <supportedRuntime version="v1.0.3705" />
    
    
      12:     </startup>
