I found an excellent [post](http://joeydotnet.com/blog/archive/2007/04/13/Having-fun-creating-reusable-components-in-MonoRail.aspx) by [joeyDotNet](http://joeydotnet.com/blog/Default.aspx) on how to start porting over ASP.NET custom server controls to [Monorail](http://www.castleproject.org/monorail/index.html) (w/ Brail).

Check it out.
