title: Seeing which Git branch I'm on via my console prompt (__git_ps1)

I like knowing which Git branch I’m currently in. I use the git-ps1 function feature that comes with git-core. If you clone or download the git source:
    
```bash    
git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/git/git.git
```

There is a file in the contrib/completion folder called git-prompt.sh:
    
```bash
~/code/git/contrib/completion(master) > ls
total 96
-rwxr-xr-x  1 user  staff    44K Apr 14 15:26 git-prompt.sh
```

I copy this file to my $HOME folder as .git-prompt.sh and then reference it and the ps1 propt feature in my .bashrc file
    
```bash    
source ~/.git-prompt.sh
export PS1='w$(__git_ps1 "(%s)") > '
```    

And now whenever I cd into a folder that is a Git repository I see something like the following prompt:
    
```bash    
~/gitosis-admin(master) >
```    

Notice the (master) notation. That is telling me I’m on the master branch. It’s just easier than issuing a “git branch” command everytime I want to know.

I know there are many other configurations out there, but I like to use the simplest thing that works.
