_update:  created armmer account after following Ben's advice below._

**To any [Twitter](http://www.twitter.com) employees out there:**

I have been trying for about a month now to get my twitter account restored.  I decided to delete it and focus on other things or a while.  I decided to come back, via the information I was told that a deleted account could be restored within 60 days.  I've submitted 2 tickets to no avail.  I know you have tons of users and you're fighting the growing pains, but can one of you please restore my account.

The account name is jmeridth.

Please help.

**To everyone who might comment:**

I had decided to just let my prior account go and create a new one, but alas I cannot.  My old account is still holding onto my email address.  I only have one email address and don't see why I should just create a new one for a twitter account.
