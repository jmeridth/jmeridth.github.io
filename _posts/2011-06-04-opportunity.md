I’ve been in major transition the last couple months. I decided to leave San Antonio and head to Dallas to work with Joe ([@agilejoe][1]) and Marcus ([@marcusthebold][2]), both are fellow LosTechies members, at [One Technologies][3]. Unfortunately, I’m heading back to San Antonio for personal reasons and would love to help fill the gap I’m leaving. Any other Alt.NET developers who love working at a fast pace, with smart people, on interesting products, should ping Joe or Marcus with your resume.

You won’t regret it. I’ve worked with both guys twice now and it has truly been a pleasure.

[Here is the link to the gist ][4]that Joe posted a while back with the job description.

Did I mention you get to work with [Github][5]? :)
