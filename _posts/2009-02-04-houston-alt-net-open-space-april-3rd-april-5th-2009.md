I've just become aware of an ALT.NET Open Space conference happening in Houston during the first week of April  Registration isn't open yet but will be soon.  I'm not involved with the event but wanted to make the announcement (thanks to [Ben Scheirman](http://flux88.com/), one of the conference administrators, for letting me know about the event[)](http://flux88.com/).  If you are in the Houston area or can make the trip down there it will be well worth it.  They are currently looking for sponsors, so any individuals or companies that can help support the event, please [contact the administrators](http://houston.altnetconf.com/home/contact).

From the home page:

_Welcome to Houston's first ALT.NET Open Spaces event! This conference is being held to allow developers to come and share their experiences, learn from each other. ALT.NET is about challenging the status-quo, continually looking for ways to better our craft, and to collaborate to create a community of mindful .NET software developers._

_What is [ALT.NET](http://houston.altnetconf.com/home/alt_net)? What is [Open Spaces](http://houston.altnetconf.com/home/open_spaces)? These ideas may be new to you, but you are encouraged to browse the site & take a look at past events to learn more. This is probably unlike any other conference you've attended in the past._
