#### _Finally. Yeah, it got delayed, not because of any huge issues, but because of various bugfixes trickling in and causing me to reset my 'release clock' all the time. But it's out there now, and hopefully better for the wait,_" Linus Torvalds said [announcing the 2.6.23 kernel](http://kerneltrap.org/mailarchive/linux-kernel/2007/10/9/333488). He noted few changes since the last release candidate, "_not a whole lot of changes since -rc9, although there's a few updates to mips, sparc64 and blackfin in there. Ignoring those arch updates, there's basically a number of mostly one-liners (mostly in drivers, but there's some networking fixes and soem VFS/VM fixes there too)._" Source level changes can be viewed via the [gitweb interface](http://git.kernel.org/?p=linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux-2.6.git;a=summary). A nice overview of all changes can be found at [Kernel Newbies](http://kernelnewbies.org/Linux_2_6_23). Linus went on to describe his plan going forward:

> "I want this to be what people look at for a few days, but expect the x86 merge to go ahead after that. So far, all indications are still that it's going to be all smooth sailing, but hey, those indicators seem to always say that, and only after the fact do people notice any problems ;)"

    Finally.
    
    Yeah, it got delayed, not because of any huge issues, but because of 
    various bugfixes trickling in and causing me to reset my "release clock" 
    all the time. But it's out there now, and hopefully better for the wait.
    
    Not a whole lot of changes since -rc9, although there's a few updates to 
    mips, sparc64 and blackfin in there.  Ignoring those arch updates, there's 
    basically a number of mostly one-liners (mostly in drivers, but there's 
    some networking fixes and soem VFS/VM fixes there too).
    
    Shortlog and diffstat appended (both relative to -rc9, of course - the 
    full log from 2.6.22 is on kernel.org as usual).
    
    I want this to be what people look at for a few days, but expect the x86 
    merge to go ahead after that. So far, all indications are still that it's 
    going to be all smooth sailing, but hey, those indicators seem to always 
    say that, and only after the fact do people notice any problems ;)
