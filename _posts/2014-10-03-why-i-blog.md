I've been asked recently why I blog.  My answer is the same since I started blogging back in 2006.  I blog for three reasons.

1. I figured out a problem/issue I was having and want to share the knowledge.  If I had the problem/issue, someone else will and hopefully google will link to my post and help them when they are searching. What I've also experienced is someone reads my post and comments with a better and/or more efficient solution.  I then can link to their comment/post or update my own.  I love that sense of community.
1. I will use a different part of my brain to write the post and, therefore (hopefully), remember the solution better next time this particular problem/issue arises.
1. I want to store the solution online, not only on my local computer (aka isolation), so that I, and others, can reference it in the future.

I **DO NOT** blog because I think it will make me popular or because I want to seem smarter than anyone else.  I enjoy learning and sharing information.
