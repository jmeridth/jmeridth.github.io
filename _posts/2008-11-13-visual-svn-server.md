Due to the new policies by [Assembla.com](http://www.assembla.com) (not allowing free private source repositories), I've had to finally grab another server and stand-up [Visual SVN Server](http://www.visualsvn.com/server/).  It's free, VERY easy to manage and worked like a charm once installed.  Kudos to the [Visual SVN](http://www.visualsvn.com/) team.

Yes, this is against my better nature as a fan of Linux and "free" software, but I had heard good things about Visual SVN Server and wanted to see for myself.

**[Vlad](#296 "2008-11-17 14:43:17"):** You could have your code hosted at devjavu (http://www.devjavu.com/). They offer simple Trac+SVN, and they felt simpler compared to the plethora of tools that assembla offers.

**[Jason Meridth](#297 "2008-11-17 14:47:44"):** @Vlad Awesome. Except, they just made the same announcement that Assembla did about closing free private repositories: http://blog.devjavu.com/2008/11/02/closing-free-project-registration/ That is what I was looking for. Thanks though.

**[Tom Opgenorth](#298 "2008-11-17 18:05:15"):** Totally agree with you here. VisualSVN is the best way to get an SVN server going, and I too have a bit of a bias towards Linux and "free" software.
