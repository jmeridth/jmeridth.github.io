MOZILLA: READ THIS!  
  
To Mozilla,  
You should upgrad ethe Hudson Build Monitor Plugin so that users don't have to create add-on accounts just to download. Cliffano's customer support and product are top of the line.  
  
Explanation:  
I have started using Hudson as my Continous Integraton server at work and still setting it up for custom interaction with Git. I have used CruiseControl.NET and TeamCity extensively in the past and both have tray tools. Well, I found [HudsonTracker](http://hudsontracker.sourceforge.net/index.html), but it wouldn't work for me because I'm using Basic HTTP Auth with my Hudson instance.  
  
I then found the [Firefox Hudson Build Monitor plugin](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/7522), written by Cliffano Subagio ([firefox developer account](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/user/1635724) and [blog](http://blog.qoqoa.com/)), but again, same problem. I decided to issue a ticket with the Firefox plugin.  
  
Within a short time (couple of days), Cliffano responded with a new version to test the HTTP Authentication against.  
  
I uninstalled the old version just to make sure of no conflict and then I right-clicked the xpi file and said to open with Firefox. It installed without issue and showed the butler in the firefox status bar:

You can right-click him and get the preferences menu:

There are 5 tabs:  
1.Feeds - where you put your RSS feed URL to your hudson dashboard

2\. Display - designate some UI elements (# of builds, what to show on status bar when collapsed, color indicators [Hudson uses blue for successful builds for some reason. Can choose green here for us Red/Green guys/gals], etc)

3\. Notification - designate how you will be notified of certain events

4\. Network - username and password for HTTP Authentication

5\. Misc - designate how to open page (new tab, new firefox window) and enable debugging

NOTE: Whenever I added my RSS feed from my Hudson dashboard to the tool (I'm using Firefox on a Mac) the URL would not stay. Cliffano had a solution for this:  
1\. Go to your Hudson dashboard  
  
2\. Right click your RSS feed of choice (I prefer "for all" which is https://hudson.mydomain.com/rssAll):  
![](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_JmjHpHPB6hg/Sa8zrDEwJKI/AAAAAAAAAWg/O7a_KGnm0Hk/s400/Picture+8.png)  
  
3\. Choose "Add Link To Hudson Build Monitor"  
![](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_JmjHpHPB6hg/Sa805kAncpI/AAAAAAAAAWw/QTkVBsYGdJM/s400/Picture+10.png)  
  
4\. Name the URL:  
![](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_JmjHpHPB6hg/Sa8141ClQGI/AAAAAAAAAW4/1EfpczqZQ5g/s400/Picture+11a.png)  
  
And VOILA! it stayed in my preferences. Most users won't have to go this route, but instead of typing out the url and just a name, it is easier.  
  
Thank you Cliffano. Hopefully Mozilla will upgrade the plugin and stop requiring people to create accounts to download it.  
  
Cliffano has stated that a 1.0 version will be coming soon. Enjoy!
