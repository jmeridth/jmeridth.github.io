### RECAP

I've been pretty busy as of late and even had some issues with the way I was trying to unit test validation.  As you can see [here](http://www.lostechies.com/blogs/joeydotnet/archive/2007/10/25/monorail-controller-test-analysis-problem-and-resolution.aspx), I was able to get some help from [Joey](http://www.lostechies.com/blogs/joeydotnet) on this and it has made me realize that I need to re-write my MonoRail Validation post to use the "correct" manner of validation.  Even Oren agrees that the [validation](http://www.ayende.com/Blog/archive/2007/10/21/The-IoC-mind-set-Validation.aspx) library in MonoRail works, it is just not the ideal way of doing it.
