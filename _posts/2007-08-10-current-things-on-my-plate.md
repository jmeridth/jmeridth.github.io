I'm doing a good deal of stuff lately:

1\. Helping build/standardize the local .NET Users group in San Antonio ([Alamo Coders](http://www.alamocoders.net))  
2\. Study/Learn/Grok [Domain Driven Design (DDD)](http://www.amazon.com/Domain-Driven-Design-Tackling-Complexity-Software/dp/0321125215) and [Behavior Driven Design (BDD)](http://dannorth.net/introducing-bdd/)  
3\. Put out a production [Monorail](http://www.castleproject.org/monorail/index.html) site for a local mom & pop shop  
4\. Heal from a bad case of [Cellulitis](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellulitis) (staph infection) in my leg (OUCH!)  
5\. Check out [Jean-Paul Boodhoo's](http://www.jpboodhoo.com/blog/) presentation next [Monday at the Austin .NET Users Group meeting](http://www.adnug.org/Home/tabid/36/ctl/Details/Mid/363/ItemID/1/Default.aspx?selecteddate=8/13/2007) (maybe not, because of my leg)  
6\. Study [Ruby](http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/)/[IronRuby](http://www.iunknown.com/2007/07/a-first-look-at.html) \- [a great place to start](http://tryruby.hobix.com/)

I'm currently reading/re-reading:

1\. [Applying Domain Driven Design](http://www.amazon.com/Applying-Domain-Driven-Design-Patterns-Examples/dp/0321268202) by Jimmy Nilsson  
2\. [Domain Driven Design](http://www.amazon.com/Domain-Driven-Design-Tackling-Complexity-Software/dp/0321125215/ref=pd_bxgy_b_img_b/105-8797962-7872444) by Eric Evans  
3\. [Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs](http://mitpress.mit.edu/book-home.tcl?isbn=0262011530), by Abelson, Sussman, and Sussman

Besides Monorail and Ruby/IronRuby, are there any new learning curves that I should possibly jump on?  Don't get me wrong, I have no intention of being a [skimmer](http://codebetter.com/blogs/scott.bellware/archive/2007/01.aspx).
