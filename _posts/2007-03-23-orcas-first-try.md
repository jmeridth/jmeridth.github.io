After reading a post by Scott Guthrie on the [new C# Orcas language features](http://weblogs.asp.net/scottgu/archive/2007/03/08/new-c-orcas-language-features-automatic-properties-object-initializers-and-collection-initializers.aspx) I decided to download Orcas and try them out.  (**excited**)  
  
The new features I practiced with and love are:  
  


  1. Object initializers  
Example:  
Prior to Orcas:  


Person person = new Person();  
person.FirstName = "Scott";  
person.LastName = "Guthrie";  
person.Age = 32;

  
Orcas:  


Person person = new Person { FirstName="Scott", LastName="Guthrie", Age=32 };

I personally like this because I like to have a constructor initializer for all my objects.  That is no longer necessary. =)  
  
  

  2. Collection initilizers  
Orcas:  


List<Person> people = new List<Person>();  
  
people.Add( new Person { FirstName = "Scott", LastName = "Guthrie", Age = 32 } );  
people.Add( new Person { FirstName = "Bill", LastName = "Gates", Age = 50 } );  
people.Add( new Person { FirstName = "Susanne", LastName = "Guthrie", Age = 32 } );  
  
  
  
The new feature I played with that I'm still not to sure about is:

  3. Automatic Properties  
Example:  
Prior to Orcas:  
  


public class Person {  
  
private string _firstName;  
private string _lastName;  
private int _age;  
  
public string FirstName {  
  
get {  
return _firstName;  
}  
set {  
_firstName = value;  
}  
}  
  
public string LastName {  
  
get {  
return _lastName;  
}  
set {  
_lastName = value;  
}  
}   
  
public int Age {  
  
get {  
return _age;  
}  
set {  
_age = value;  
}  
}  
}

  
  
Orcas:  
  


public class Person {  
public string FirstName { get; set; }  
public string LastName { get; set; }   
public int Age { get; set; }  
}

Guthrie's post has links to Bart deSmart's blog where he shows what happens under the covers for each of these features.  
  
More to come.
