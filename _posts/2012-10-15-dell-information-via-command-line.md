To get your Dell Service Tag from your workstation/laptop via command line:

```bash
C:\>wmic csproduct get vendor,name,identifyingnumber
IdentifyingNumber    Name                Vendor
ABCDEF1              Latitude E6520      Dell Inc.
```

I looked for this and found it because my laptop was docked and I didnâ€™t want to have to dock it to look on the bottom of the laptop
