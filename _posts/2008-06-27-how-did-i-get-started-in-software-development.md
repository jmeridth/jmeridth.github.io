Thanks for tagging me [Joey.](http://joeybeninghove.lostechies.com)

**How old were you when you started programming?**

I was 11 years old (6th grade) when I started using QBasic to make easy games.  I actually knew about the easter egg that showed the developer names. 

**What was your first language?**

Like Joey I used to write basic apps with QBasic and even mimicked a Windows Blue screen for fun.  I also used to code my TI calculators for games  when I was bored.  Pascal was my first third generation language for school and then hopped to ANSI C and C++.  Java and C# followed.  Python and Ruby are my new study items.****

**What was the first real program you wrote?**

Mentioned above .  It was games written in QBasic.  For friends and family.****

**If you knew then what you know now, would you have started programming?**

Most definitely.  This is one of those industries where you get to learn about other industries.  You get this because you write software for them. :) 

**If there is one thing you learned along the way that you would tell new developers, what would it be?**

The easiest answer is to go read "Pragmatic Programmer" by Hunt and Thomas, then go pair program with someone with Agile (Scrum/XP) experience.  I'm not trying to start an Agile flame war, but in my personal experience it works.

**What's the most fun you've ever had ... programming?**

The current team I'm on successfully wrote an internal web app for our mortgage company, with 6000+ unit tests, pair programming, continuous integration, and other little goodies.  The best part: project finished ahead of schedule, under budget, with zero defects, and a VERY happy end user.  That is fun.  Lasted almost a year.
