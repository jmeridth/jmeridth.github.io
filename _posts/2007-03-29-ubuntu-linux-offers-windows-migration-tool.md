The newest version of Ubuntu 7.04 BETA is offering a new Windows migration tool.  According to the [website](http://www.ubuntu.com/news/Ubuntu704Beta), it will recognize and migrate "Internet Explorer favorites, Firefox favorites, desktop wallpaper, AOL IM contacts, and Yahoo IM contacts" during the install process.

I believe this is a huge step up to possibly convine a normal home user to switch to Linux.
