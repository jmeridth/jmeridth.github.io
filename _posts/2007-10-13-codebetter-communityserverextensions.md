I like to give people credit when I use their software.  One particular developer is [Brendan Tompkins](http://devlicio.us/blogs/brendantompkins/default.aspx) of [Devlicio.us](http://devlicio.us/).

We (LosTechies) have added 2 features available from his [CodeBetter.CommunityServerExtensions](http://codebetter.com/files/folders/community_server_add-ons/entry162534.aspx): 

**Kick It:** For those that don't know, the "Kick Icategory at the bottom of our posts create or add to the count of posts on [DotNetKicks](http://www.dotnetkicks.com/).  This helps expose LosTechies to more readers through [DotNetKicks](http://www.dotnetkicks.com/).

**Captcha:** This feature is a security measure to prevent spam comments and other non-legitimate items on LosTechies.

**2 notes on the Captcha module:  
**1\. From research, Brendan's Captcha module is the best one out there for CS 2007.  
2\. If you are a member (logged-in) to the CS blogs, you won't see the Captcha module.  It is used for individuals who are not logged-in (trusted) to the site.

Kudos to Brendan.
