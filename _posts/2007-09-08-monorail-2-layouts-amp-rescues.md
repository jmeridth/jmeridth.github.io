## **_LAYOUTS_**

**_UPDATED: Used the Code Snippet plug-in_**

Layouts are like [master pages](http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/wtxbf3hh.aspx) or template pages in Adobe DreamWeaver.  They allow you to template your site.  I have a default.vm under my ../Views/layouts folder and the way to make a controller utilize the layout is to add a layout attribute to the class definition:
    
    
       1: using System;
    
    
       2: using Castle.MonoRail.Framework;
    
    
       3:  
    
    
       4: namespace JasonMeridth.Controllers
    
    
       5: {
    
    
       6:     [Layout("default"), Rescue("generalerror")]
    
    
       7:     public class ExampleController : SmartDispatcherController
    
    
       8:     {


As you probably saw in my last post, it wasn't just a simple "hello world" text on a white background.    
The reason I had a design was due to the ****[Layout attribute](http://api.castleproject.org/html/T_Castle_MonoRail_Framework_LayoutAttribute.htm) on the ExampleController class.    
Layouts are simply NVelocity files (or whichever viewing engine you chose) placed in the /Views/layouts folder.  In my case it is the default.vm file:

**[LDWebb  ](#79 "2008-09-09 16:09:39"):** I don't want to post this message I am running into some issues with presidence of rescues at the controller level and wanted to define certain rescues at the action level, I was reviewing your article, which has very important details, but the text is cut off in sections. The sections that I am interested in are "The controller has a designated rescue file:" and "The controller has NO designated rescue file:". I was wondering if I could get a soft copy of this article in word or text format.
