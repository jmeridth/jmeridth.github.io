I apologize for the delay of this post.  It was a great weekend and I learned a great deal about other developers and myself.  It has also made me hit the code harder.  I don't know how Oren or 

#### BREAKFAST

I had a chance to meet with some developers while eating breakfast. I had an opportunity to speak with [Dru Sellers](http://www.drusellers.com), added [siteroot](http://www.castleproject.org/MonoRail/gettingstarted/firstcontroller.html) (it's equivalent to ~/ in ASP.NET, scroll down to "Creating the layout") to MonoRail, and [Chris Patterson](http://blog.phatboyg.com/).  They were both articulate, intelligent, and a blast to chat with.

Here they are: (Chris on left, Dru on right)

Disclaimer: EVERY developer I had an opportunity to speak with was passionate, intelligent, excited about the sessions, and couldn't wait to get back to their teams/jobs to help spread the knowledge.  I will stop stating the same thing over and over about each of these people that I met.

While enjoying breakfast with [Nelson](http://codemonkey.nmonta.com/) and [Joe](http://blog.agilejoe.com), Jay Flowers of [CI Factory](http://www.cifactory.org/joomla/) walked up with one of the best shirts I saw all conference.

#### SESSIONS

**DSL**  
I sat in this one for about 5 minutes because when everyone started looking around an no one knew who convened the session I decided to go check out the "Passion" session.  On my way out, Martin Fowler and Scott Guthrie were headed in.  I did a double take before deciding to continue to the other session.

**PASSION**  
I walked into this session late.  I missed JP Boodhoo's intro (I really wish I hadn't, I heard it was good).  I listened for a while.  When [Rod Paddock](http://blog.dashpoint.com/) asked, "How do you start passion amongst other team-mates or other teams you work with or user groups?", my alpha personality and loud voice kicked in.  I mentioned items like blogs and the ["Pragmatic Programmer"](http://www.pragprog.com/the-pragmatic-programmer) book by Thomas and Hunt.  I made the mistake of focusing on the tools and processes and if you notice the specific line from the [Agile Manifesto](http://agilemanifesto.org/), "Individuals and interactions over processes and tools" you'll understand (I am in no means stating that processes or tools are useless - check out the last line "That is, while there is value in the items on the right, we value the items on the left more").  I sometimes focus too much on the code.  Nothing makes me smile larger than beautiful code, but after this weekend I realized there is something more valuable:  watching another developer have that "aha" moment when they are coding, talking to another developer, etc.  It's priceless (and THAT is what the ALT.net [place fav label here
