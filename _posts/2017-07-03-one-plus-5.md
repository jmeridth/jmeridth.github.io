## OnePlus 5

I've had a Nexus 6 for the last 2 years and was finally due for a phone upgrade.  I went through a pretty good fiasco with Google store trying to purchase a Google Pixel XL earlier this year so I decided to wait for the One Plus 5 (release late June).  I ordered it the first hour it was announced.

Features that I'm loving:

- 8 GB RAM
- 128 GB hard drive
- dash charge
- USB C
- OxygenOS (Android fork)
- headphone jack
- fingerprint authentication
- dual camera (allows for portrait mode) 16 MP
- front camera 16 MP
- Dual SIM support

More detailed specs can be found [here](https://oneplus.net/5/specs)

Features I'm adjusting to:

- no Google Phone app install allowed
- no Google Contacts app install allowed

I'll adjust to those over time.

I did entertain the iPhone 7 for a bit also but am not a fan of iTunes.  The iPhone integration with Google apps has gotten much better since the last time I looked though.

Cheers.
