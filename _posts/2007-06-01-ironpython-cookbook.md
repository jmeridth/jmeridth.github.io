Scott Guthrie has posted a notice of the [IronPython Cookbook](http://www.ironpython.info/index.php/Contents) wiki that is now online.  I have Python experience via scripting in Linux.  It's a very cool language.  It takes some time getting used to no brackets if you are a C-type language developer, but otherwise it is just as powerful as some of the other functional languages out there. (i.e., Ruby, etc.)

Side Note: If you are in San Antonio and are interested in learning about Ruby, there is a local Ruby group now.  [San Antonio Ruby Users Group](http://www.saruby.org/)
