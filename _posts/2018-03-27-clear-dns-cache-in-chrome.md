I'm blogging this because I keep forgetting how to do it.  Yeah, yeah, I can google it.  I run this blog so I know it is always available.....anywho.

<!--more-->
Go To:

    chrome://net-internals/#dns

Click "Clear host cache" button

![clear_dns_cache_in_chrome]({{ site.url }}/images/clear_dns_cache_in_chrome.png)


Hope this helps someone else.

Cheers.
