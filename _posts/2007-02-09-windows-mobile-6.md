Microsoft announced the release of Windows Mobile 6 will during the second quarter of 2007.

The new version will include Microsoft Live features and also allow the user to create/edit Microsoft Office items and retain their same format/layout.

I'm extremely interested in this since I have a [Palm Treo 700w](http://www.palm.com/us/products/smartphones/treo700w/) and my wife has a Pocket PC with Windows Mobile 5.
