I went through a pretty good fiasco with Google store trying to purchase a Google Pixel XL earlier this year so I decided to wait for the One Plus 5 (release late June). I ordered it the first hour it was announced.
Features that I&amp;rsquo;m loving:
8 GB RAM 128 GB hard drive dash charge USB C OxygenOS (Android fork) headphone jack fingerprint authentication dual camera (allows for portrait mode) 16 MP front camera 16 MP Dual SIM support More detailed specs can be found here</description></item></channel></rss>
