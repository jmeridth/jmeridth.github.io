&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://pragprog.com/images/covers/original/sdcoach.jpg" alt=""&gt;My manager let me borrow his copy of &lt;a href="http://pragprog.com/titles/sdcoach/agile-coaching" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Pragmatic Programmer’s Agile Coaching&lt;/a&gt;. I’ve read a good number of Agile process and management books. I’m partial to the Pragmatic Programmer publishers due to their consistently well-written books. I also started using stickies instead of pens/pencils when I read my books. Mainly because they stand out better and allow me to find my notes quicker. The other reason is because I can remove them when I give the book away (which I’ve done a good deal lately. Of course, not with this book since it was my boss’). The stickies I use are &lt;a href="http://www.3m.com/us/office/postit/products/prod_ft_pgm.html" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;these&lt;/a&gt; and can be found at most office stores.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>How did I get started in software development?</title><link>http://jmeridth.com/posts/how-did-i-get-started-in-software-development/</link><pubDate>Fri, 27 Jun 2008 22:41:00 -0500</pubDate><guid>http://jmeridth.com/posts/how-did-i-get-started-in-software-development/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Thanks for tagging me &lt;a href="http://joeybeninghove.lostechies.com" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Joey.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How old were you when you started programming?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was 11 years old (6th grade) when I started using QBasic to make easy games.  I actually knew about the easter egg that showed the developer names.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What was your first language?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like Joey I used to write basic apps with QBasic and even mimicked a Windows Blue screen for fun.  I also used to code my TI calculators for games  when I was bored.  Pascal was my first third generation language for school and then hopped to ANSI C and C++.  Java and C# followed.  Python and Ruby are my new study items.****&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>People vs. tools</title><link>http://jmeridth.com/posts/people-vs-tools/</link><pubDate>Mon, 26 Nov 2007 00:38:00 -0600</pubDate><guid>http://jmeridth.com/posts/people-vs-tools/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m not a very theoretical guy.  I don&amp;rsquo;t like to discuss things to no solution.  When presented with a new idea, I like to see the code, tool, or mechanism that helps put that theory/idea into action.  I&amp;rsquo;m fine tuning (still working very hard at) my people skills.  I know that in order for software to succeed it&amp;rsquo;s the communication that matters.  I can usually make people think about what they want and they usually know they need to be prepared when they approach me, because I don&amp;rsquo;t like to waste time.  I like the occasional &amp;ldquo;check my email&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;watch that YouTube video&amp;rdquo;; so don&amp;rsquo;t get me wrong.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>ThoughtWorks Mingle</title><link>http://jmeridth.com/posts/thoughtworks-mingle/</link><pubDate>Thu, 01 Nov 2007 18:40:00 -0500</pubDate><guid>http://jmeridth.com/posts/thoughtworks-mingle/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;I got excited about ThoughtWorks releasing &lt;a href="http://www.lostechies.com/controlpanel/blogs/Saifuddin%20Goderya" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Mingle 1.1&lt;/a&gt;.  The software license states that it is free for the first 5 users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have used older version of ThoughtProcess and their new one looks sweet, but expensive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today however, I installed MySql (no worries) and then Mingle and as soon as the service started my server went to a hault.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; This is what I saw when I opend the task manager:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every morning at 9am we have our daily stand-up/scrum to enlighten the whole team and let everyone know what is going on.  We have a schedule sheet that dictates the primary organizer that week and who their backup is.  This week it is my duty.  I had it a couple of times last week also because the primary was off work or was handling a critical business item.  Either way we had stand-up coverage.  If both people are out, the following week&amp;rsquo;s primary is next in line, etc.  You get the idea.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Be kind to your testers</title><link>http://jmeridth.com/posts/be-kind-to-your-testers/</link><pubDate>Thu, 27 Sep 2007 00:31:44 -0500</pubDate><guid>http://jmeridth.com/posts/be-kind-to-your-testers/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Jeremy Miller posted about &lt;a href="http://codebetter.com/blogs/jeremy.miller/archive/2007/09/18/testers-are-pigs.aspx" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Testers being pigs&lt;/a&gt;.  I have learned through my current position that he is completely correct.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Legend:
Developer
Systems Analyst (tester)
Business Analyst (domain expert)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In our planning sessions all three groups are involved.  If questions arise during development, it is the developer&amp;rsquo;s responsibility to make sure all parties are informed of any new changes.  Today we had something come up.  The other developer I was pair programming with and I went to the domain expert and clarified the question which did result in changes.  We then headed to the tester and made sure he was aware of the changes and also asked him if this would change his initial estimate on testing time.  We also made sure to see if he had any new questions after the change was decided (he may have thought of something we didn&amp;rsquo;t).&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Agile Cheat Sheet</title><link>http://jmeridth.com/posts/agile-cheat-sheet/</link><pubDate>Tue, 18 Sep 2007 23:08:58 -0500</pubDate><guid>http://jmeridth.com/posts/agile-cheat-sheet/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Excellent &lt;a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/GrabBagOfT/~3/158079288/agile-cheat-sheet.html" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;post&lt;/a&gt; by Jimmy Bogard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6 id="legacy-code-is-code-that-you-but-is-too-valuable-or-big-to-toss-away"&gt;
 &lt;strong&gt;Legacy code is code that you&amp;rsquo;re afraid of&lt;/strong&gt;, but is too valuable or big to toss away
 &lt;a class="heading-link" href="#legacy-code-is-code-that-you-but-is-too-valuable-or-big-to-toss-away"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I lean more toward the Single Responsibility and Design Pattern habits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This conversation was sparked due to us creating a mapper service for our application.  When the mapper is called it&amp;rsquo;s responsibility is to move values from one domain object to another.  Utilized in the mapper is a factory that returns a strategy, when passed a specific enum value.  The strategy handles the move of 3-4 specific fields based on the enum value.  This makes it more extensible when another value is added to that enum.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>The end user</title><link>http://jmeridth.com/posts/the-end-user/</link><pubDate>Tue, 30 Jan 2007 01:01:00 -0600</pubDate><guid>http://jmeridth.com/posts/the-end-user/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;I was recently speaking with a co-worker about how some projects get into a Death March because the development team never had the opportunity to speak with/see the end user.  On another project, I requested that I be able to sit with the end user for a full business day.  From that experience I was able to determine more about the software needs of the user than my entire business staff combined.  We realized that we didn&amp;rsquo;t need certain sections of the application, but needed to beef up the main portion (the part the user utilized 99% of the time).&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Free Agile Project Management Tools</title><link>http://jmeridth.com/posts/free-agile-project-management-tools/</link><pubDate>Wed, 24 Jan 2007 00:57:00 -0600</pubDate><guid>http://jmeridth.com/posts/free-agile-project-management-tools/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;I think it is awesome when a company like TargetProcess, who makes the BEST agile management tool out there, creates a site to allow new users/companies to use a free alternative.  They do this because they know if you are truly serious about managing your project correctly, you&amp;rsquo;ll purchase TargetProcess.
