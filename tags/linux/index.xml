&lt;p&gt;I have decided to finally get the RHCSA and RHCE certifications. RHCSA stands for Redhat Certified System Adminitrator and RHCE stands for Redhat Certified Engineer. The reason I decided on these exams is for 2 reasons:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They are not multiple choice. You sit at a kiosk with VNC and are given a live RHEL (Redhat Enterprise Linux) instance and are given issues to fix (aka Real World)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A stepping stone to me finally taking my Linux knowledge/skills seriously.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

My only complaint has been Unity. It is not user friendly. It makes my 8GB RAM laptop go slow. I even researched disabling it. Seems that is quite the feat in Ubuntu these days. I&amp;rsquo;m a minimalist when it comes to my computers. I remember Gnome and have always been a fan. However, due to an article I read the other day, I decided to read up on &lt;a href="http://linuxmint.com" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Linux Mint&lt;/a&gt; and remembered a co-worker was using it as his primary OS. I have also been playing with Fedora more lately due to its support for containers. I feel that is the future on application deployments. However, since Mint is based on Debian and Ubuntu, it is more of a comfort thing for me. My co-workers suggestion was to try out &lt;a href="http://cinnamon.linuxmint.com0" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Cinnamon&lt;/a&gt;. As an Ubuntu package for cinnamon is &lt;a href="http://askubuntu.com/questions/94201/how-do-i-install-the-cinnamon-desktop" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;no longer maintained&lt;/a&gt;, I found a PPA that is still being maintained of the Cinnamon &lt;em&gt;stable&lt;/em&gt; branch (yes, I am aware the Cinnamon maintainer has a PPA for nightly builds, but I&amp;rsquo;m not quite that brave). I installed it with:&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Getting a Canon MX450 Series Working With Ubuntu 14.04</title><link>http://jmeridth.com/posts/getting-a-canon-mx450-series-working-with-ubuntu-1404/</link><pubDate>Thu, 08 Jan 2015 21:03:55 -0600</pubDate><guid>http://jmeridth.com/posts/getting-a-canon-mx450-series-working-with-ubuntu-1404/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Today I needed to scan something on my Canon MX450 series printer from my laptop running Ubuntu 14.04 LTS. I had already setup the printer portion successfully with the built in network printer detection, but hadn&amp;rsquo;t done the scanning portion. I found out I needed to download a deb file and install something called scangearmp to get this to work. The download button can be found &lt;a href="http://support-sg.canon-asia.com/contents/SG/EN/0100517701.html" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. As of this post I&amp;rsquo;ve download version 2.10 which was last updated on 14-Feb-2013, Issue Number 0100517701. Once downloaded issue the following commands:&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Restarting Audio in Ubuntu After Issues</title><link>http://jmeridth.com/posts/restarting-audio-in-ubuntu-after-issues/</link><pubDate>Thu, 08 Jan 2015 11:12:14 -0600</pubDate><guid>http://jmeridth.com/posts/restarting-audio-in-ubuntu-after-issues/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;The following command restarted audio for me in Ubuntu after my microphone on my headphones stopped working.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

Out of the box I&amp;rsquo;ve had no issues. Wireless, VPN, Terminal, Dropbox, Google Drive, LastPass, etc all work. I was spending more time in my &lt;a href="https://www.vagrantup.com/" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Vagrant&lt;/a&gt; VMs with OSX anyway. Loved &lt;a href="https://www.virtualbox.org/" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;VirtualBox&lt;/a&gt; + Vagrant. Never had an issue. I just wasn&amp;rsquo;t using any portion of OSX. It is nice to troubleshoot any issues and tweak my setup. I&amp;rsquo;m getting used to Unity and may drop it for Gnome3 and Gnome-Do. We&amp;rsquo;ll see. Any new things I troubleshoot or find, I&amp;rsquo;ll post on.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
