Yeah, yeah, I’m a little behind. Anyways, It upgraded just fine. However when I was trying to push code to my gitosis instance (which I installed over a year ago), I got the following stack trace:
~/code/gitosis-admin(master) &amp;gt; git pull origin master /usr/bin/gitosis-serve:5: UserWarning: Unbuild egg for setuptools [unknown version] (/usr/lib/python2.</description></item><item><title>Gitosis and Gitweb - Part 3</title><link>http://jmeridth.com/posts/gitosis-and-gitweb-part-3/</link><pubDate>Wed, 26 May 2010 04:45:00 -0500</pubDate><guid>http://jmeridth.com/posts/gitosis-and-gitweb-part-3/</guid><description>Gitosis and Gitweb – Part 1
Gitosis and Gitweb – Part 2
So we are setup, have a project, and have contributors via the first 2 parts.
I know that we are all enamored by the UI of GitHub.com. I am. Unfortunately you can’t get private repositories for free (In all fairness it’s only $7/mo. – a very wise investment). I am aware of Gitorious like I mentioned in the first part, but I have no experience with that.</description></item><item><title>Gitosis and Gitweb - Part 2 - Add Projects and Contributors</title><link>http://jmeridth.com/posts/gitosis-and-gitweb-part-2/</link><pubDate>Tue, 25 May 2010 03:02:00 -0500</pubDate><guid>http://jmeridth.com/posts/gitosis-and-gitweb-part-2/</guid><description>Gitosis and Gitweb – Part 1
So we are setup now thanks to Part 1.
Gitosis repository contents Link to heading If we issue the “find .” command locally inside the gitosis-admin directory we will see the following:
~/gitosis-admin(master) &amp;gt; find . &amp;lt;a bunch of files from .git folder) ./gitosis.conf ./keydir ./keydir/user@local.pub We have the .git folder, a gitosis.conf file, and a keydir with a pub key file.
Add our first project Link to heading Our project name for this example is lostechies.</description></item><item><title>Gitosis and Gitweb - Part 1 - Setup</title><link>http://jmeridth.com/posts/gitosis-and-gitweb-part-1/</link><pubDate>Tue, 25 May 2010 02:42:00 -0500</pubDate><guid>http://jmeridth.com/posts/gitosis-and-gitweb-part-1/</guid><description>I’ve had a number of people ask me where they should host their Git repositories. Of course, my default question back is, “Can the code be public or does it need to be private?”. Usually they say, “public”. Therefore, my repsonse is Github.com. If they say, “private” I still say Github. If they don&amp;rsquo;t &amp;ldquo;trust&amp;rdquo; Github, which they should - click the link, then my response is Gitosis and Gitweb. This is by no means the only solution.</description></item></channel></rss>
