I am usually of the mindset “explicit over implicit” so whenever I needed to use a finder to get content for that model I would do something like:
User.where(deleted: false) That does lean towards not having DRY (don’t repeat yourself) code. It’s a balancing act. I decided to give default_scope a chance this time.</description></item><item><title>Has And Belongs To Many Join Table Name Must Be In Alphabetical Order</title><link>http://jmeridth.com/posts/has-and-belongs-to-many-join-table-name-must-be-in-alphabetical-order/</link><pubDate>Sun, 03 Feb 2013 00:00:00 -0600</pubDate><guid>http://jmeridth.com/posts/has-and-belongs-to-many-join-table-name-must-be-in-alphabetical-order/</guid><description>TL;DR
Read this from the Rails Guides
Today I created an explicit join table between two models because each had has_and_belongs_to_many, as I’ve done many time before. Except, this time, when I tried to render one of my views, it said it couldn’t find a join table.
Example:
I created users_roles and the view error stated it was looking for roles_users.
Incorrect:
users_roles Correct:
roles_users My first inclination was the fact that it was looking for it in alphabetical order.</description></item><item><title>Create Rails Application in Current Directory</title><link>http://jmeridth.com/posts/create-rails-application-in-current-directory/</link><pubDate>Thu, 25 Oct 2012 00:00:00 -0500</pubDate><guid>http://jmeridth.com/posts/create-rails-application-in-current-directory/</guid><description>Yes, I know the common way to create a Rails application is
rails new and this will create a subfolder with your new Rails application called .
This post is because I keep forgetting how to create a new Rails application if I’m already in the subfolder.
If your folder name is the same name you plan to use for your application you can use the command below:

The last few times I created a new slice or restaged a laptop/desktop with Ubuntu I always seem to have an issue when I try to run the Rails console:
