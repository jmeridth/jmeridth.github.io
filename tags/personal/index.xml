My answer is the following:
I wrote my first program in the Basic programming language on an IBM PS/2 when I was eight years old (1988) and loved that I could control a computer and build software. In 1991 when QBasic came out I learned about the easter egg that you can do when starting QBasic from a DOS prompt.</description></item><item><title>What I do</title><link>http://jmeridth.com/posts/what-i-do/</link><pubDate>Thu, 20 Dec 2007 20:28:00 -0600</pubDate><guid>http://jmeridth.com/posts/what-i-do/</guid><description>In response to being tagged by Ben Scheirman:
I&amp;rsquo;m a full-time software developer currently working for Wachovia (formerly World Savings) in San Antonio, TX. I&amp;rsquo;m a lead developer on the team I&amp;rsquo;m on. This doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean I&amp;rsquo;m a master developer, it just means that upper management has deemed my coding quality sufficient and also that I have the tendencies to be a leader.
Our current project is an ASP.NET 2.0 Domain.</description></item></channel></rss>
