&lt;p&gt;I have decided to finally get the RHCSA and RHCE certifications. RHCSA stands for Redhat Certified System Adminitrator and RHCE stands for Redhat Certified Engineer. The reason I decided on these exams is for 2 reasons:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They are not multiple choice. You sit at a kiosk with VNC and are given a live RHEL (Redhat Enterprise Linux) instance and are given issues to fix (aka Real World)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A stepping stone to me finally taking my Linux knowledge/skills seriously.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
