I have decided to finally get the RHCSA and RHCE certifications. RHCSA stands for Redhat Certified System Adminitrator and RHCE stands for Redhat Certified Engineer. The reason I decided on these exams is for 2 reasons:
They are not multiple choice. You sit at a kiosk with VNC and are given a live RHEL (Redhat Enterprise Linux) instance and are given issues to fix (aka Real World) A stepping stone to me finally taking my Linux knowledge/skills seriously.</description></item></channel></rss>
