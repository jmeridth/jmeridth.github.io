In Ruby</title><link>http://jmeridth.com/posts/double-exclamations-in-ruby/</link><pubDate>Sun, 03 Feb 2013 00:00:00 -0600</pubDate><guid>http://jmeridth.com/posts/double-exclamations-in-ruby/</guid><description>Today I hit this in a Ruby example online:
def role?(role) return !!self.roles.find_by_name(role.to_s.camelize) end Note the double exclamation (!!). This converts the value to boolean.
!! is just ! (the boolean negation operator) written twice. It will negate the argument, then negate the negation. It’s useful because you can use it to get a boolean from any value. The first ! will convert the argument to a boolean, e.g. true if it’s nil or false, and false otherwise.</description></item><item><title>Git post-merge hook to auto-fire rails migrations</title><link>http://jmeridth.com/posts/git-post-merge-hook-to-auto-fire-rails-migrations/</link><pubDate>Sat, 27 Feb 2010 19:28:00 -0600</pubDate><guid>http://jmeridth.com/posts/git-post-merge-hook-to-auto-fire-rails-migrations/</guid><description>I saw Scott Bellware recently write on twitter:
for christmas, i really want a git hook to detect if an update has changes in the db/migrations folder
Cory Foy, Aaron Jensen, and [myself]({{ site.twitter.url }}) all responded in turn. I think Cory and I were quickly searching for which git hook could be used for this idea. Cory found it first and it was the post-merge/post-rebase hooks. I researched the post-merge hook (scroll down to post-merge) and noticed it has no params that we could work with to find out if the last commit had migrations (aka changes/additions to db/migrations folder in a rails project) I came up with the following</description></item><item><title>'Bad Interpreter: No Medium' error when running Ruby from Git Bash</title><link>http://jmeridth.com/posts/bad-interpreter-no-medium-error-when-running-ruby-from-git-bash/</link><pubDate>Tue, 06 Oct 2009 14:50:00 -0500</pubDate><guid>http://jmeridth.com/posts/bad-interpreter-no-medium-error-when-running-ruby-from-git-bash/</guid><description>I opened my Windows VM last night for the first time in months to finally work on a .NET project from Github. When I found out I needed the rspec gem installed (I&amp;rsquo;m normally a shoulda guy), I decided to see what gems I had installed first:

The format of most of the chapters made the book an interesting read:
A introduction to why you might need the pattern A static language developer&amp;rsquo;s approach with the Ruby language A seasoned Ruby developer&amp;rsquo;s approach to the design pattern Using and Abusing In the wild Wrapping up Some of the items that I learned [LosTechies is not a cult contrary to some of the examples you read below; some of the examples below are using LosTechies nomenclature but closely resemble what the author had in the book] If any of the stuff below intrigues you: GO BUY THE BOOK.</description></item></channel></rss>
