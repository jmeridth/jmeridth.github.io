Don&amp;rsquo;t forget that.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Recently I&amp;rsquo;ve been hearing more and more developers say stuff like &amp;ldquo;Wow, what was this person thinking when they wrote this?&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;Really? Sigh&amp;hellip;..&amp;rdquo;. Don&amp;rsquo;t get me wrong. I&amp;rsquo;ve been guilty of this also. I am writing this post to remind myself and other developers that if you could, you would say those things to yourself of six months ago or even yesterday. We are all continually improving and we started writing bad, inexperienced code just like some of the code your reading now. I also saw someone say &amp;ldquo;Bad code doesn&amp;rsquo;t immediately become bad; it happens over time, gradually.&amp;rdquo; (thanks &lt;a href="https://github.com/scichelli" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sharon&lt;/a>) That is true.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
