that URL is /contribute on the the end of the repository URL. For example, the URL for the github.com/jmeridth/jmeridth.github.io repository is https://github.com/jmeridth/jmeridth.github.io/contribute
You can search multiple repositories with GitHub&amp;rsquo;s new https://forgoodfirstissue.</description></item><item><title>Details HTML Section In Github Issues and Gists</title><link>http://jmeridth.com/posts/details-html-section-in-github-issues-and-gists/</link><pubDate>Thu, 28 Jul 2016 11:01:00 -0500</pubDate><guid>http://jmeridth.com/posts/details-html-section-in-github-issues-and-gists/</guid><description>I recently became aware of using the &amp;lt;details&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/details&amp;gt; and &amp;lt;summary&amp;gt;...&amp;lt;/summary&amp;gt; tags in Github issues and Gists.

That means changes you did not intend to be there, would now be there.
