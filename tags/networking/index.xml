I&amp;rsquo;ve been meeting a lot of new people and trying to get to know them. I&amp;rsquo;ve been using a template to help me remember the important things about them.

sudo dhclient -r [eth0] &amp;amp;amp;&amp;amp;amp; sudo dhclient [eth0] I add that command as an alias to my ~/.bashrc file
alias resetdhcp=&amp;#39;sudo dhclient -r eth0 &amp;amp;amp;&amp;amp;amp; sudo dhclient eth0&amp;#39; then resourced it so I could use it in the bash session I was in
source ~/.bashrc I constantly have my Ubuntu VM (VirtualBox) running on my Windows laptop and dock/undock it between work and home. Obviously those are two different wireless networks.</description></item></channel></rss>
