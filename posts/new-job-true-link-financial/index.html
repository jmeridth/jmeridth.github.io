You link it to their bank account or another source of funding and you can set limitations on when, where and how the card can be used.  The family member feels freedom by not having to continually ask for money but is also protected by scammers and non-friendly people (yep, they exist)."><meta name=keywords content="jason meridth,meridth,jm,software developer"><meta name=fediverse:creator content><meta name=twitter:card content="summary"><meta name=twitter:title content="New Job: True Link Financial"><meta name=twitter:description content="Well, it is a new year and I’ve started a new job.
