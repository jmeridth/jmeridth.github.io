<span class=sr-only>Link to heading</span></a></h2><p><strong><a href=#58 title="2007-08-26 14:43:19">Glenn</a>:</strong> Freaky&mldr;I just put in the support request as well. Nice to know they&rsquo;&rsquo; do it.</p><p><strong><a href=#59 title="2007-08-26 16:14:20">Jason Meridth</a>:</strong> If they tell you that you need to upgrade, they are incorrect. That is why I had to submit a second ticket. Don&rsquo;t let them talk you into an upgrade.</p><p><strong><a href=#60 title="2008-10-14 04:54:30">Jacky</a>:</strong> Webhost4life is definately the best hosting company i use so far. Their price is cheap and their support is awesome. Webhost4life ROCKS! Keep up the good work guys =) I am referring customers to you for sure.</p><p><strong><a href=#61 title="2008-10-18 21:53:36">Jordan</a>:</strong> I&rsquo;ve been with webhost4life for several years, those guys make me impressive and life easily. I always introduce my friends and my colleagues to host with them; This is my blogs &ldquo;2trees.cn&rdquo;; if you want to host your website with them, you may refer to the url:www.webhost4life.com/default.asp?refid=memberid to review their website. you can get a live chat with the guys.Hehe Jordan L.</p><p><strong><a href=#62 title="2008-10-29 18:02:30">Ryan</a>:</strong> I too have something to say about this company. Hope this is helpful. WebHost4Life is clearly the best Windows based Web host service I know of. But to say this actually surprised myself, because I have been trying to find a “better” host company and moved away from WebHost4Life in the past year and half. I looked for alternative providers not because of any bad service I see, but because the bad ratings I see from online forums abut Webhost4Life. Now after trying 4 other Windows hosting providers, I can confidently say that WebHost4Life stands out among competitions and I will be a happy customer for a long time to come. WebHost4Life has many advantages over the competitions, and what I specifically like is the flexibility they provide for the site mangers. For example, their Control Panel web site is more user-friendly and much faster than those of other providers I tried. (most other providers use Plesk what I just hate! Too slow!!) For SQL Server hosting, the Control Panel allows site mangers to backup and restore SQL Server databases in a DIY-way without having to submitting a support ticket. This is very convenient. Plus, their online support has always been prompt and helpful. I highly recommend WebHost4Life. The site I host with WebHost4life is Karooba.com. We have high hope for this site (we hope it is the next big thing to come) and have worked hard to find the best web hosting provider. I can confidently say that WebHost4Life is the one!</p></div><footer></footer></article></section></div><footer class=footer><section class=container>©
