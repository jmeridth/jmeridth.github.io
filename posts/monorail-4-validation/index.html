AFAIK the MR validation uses this library: <a href=http://www.tetlaw.id.au/view/javascript/really-easy-field-validation target=_blank>http://www.tetlaw.id.au/view/javascript/really-easy-field-validation</a> That in turn uses prototype, which should be able to handle inserting stuff in IE7 with ease. I assume the error was happening when the validation messages were trying to appear?</p><p><strong><a href=#128 title="2007-09-26 19:38:08">Jason Meridth</a>:</strong> I did comment on Hammett&rsquo;s post but can&rsquo;t find the comment. Did he update the blog entry? Where is it exactly? Nice post on validation. I will definitely try it out. Yes, the error was appearing when the messages were trying to appear.</p><p><strong><a href=#129 title="2007-09-26 20:21:19">Joe Ocampo</a>:</strong> Nice post&mldr; Don&rsquo;t know how crazy I am about decorating my Domain object with validation constructs BUT I am in simplification rehab for this. (mumbling to self) must simplify, it will be ok. must simplify, its ok&mldr;.. :-)</p><p><strong><a href=#130 title="2007-09-26 22:07:00">Sean Chambers</a>:</strong> Jason, Very detailed post! I agree with Joe that I cringe at the idea of decorating domain objects with validation attributes. Although I have done quite a bit of research and thought about it alot without coming up with a better scenario without creating more headaches as a result. At one point in a recent project I had a generic ValidationBase controller that the controller derived from and I could then call a Validate method returning errors if not passed. This was for a Controller Wizard, hence the generics. I have been thinking about this a lot recently so perhaps I can come up with an alternative. Great post, keep it up!</p><p><strong><a href=#131 title="2007-09-27 00:03:59">Jason Meridth</a>:</strong> I completely agree with you and Joe, hence my second opening paragraph. I love the idea of a ValidationBase controller. I&rsquo;m check out Colin&rsquo;s javascript validation stuff and I look forward to posts about your base validation mechanism. Excellent!</p><p><strong><a href=#132 title="2007-09-27 00:51:41">joeyDotNet</a>:</strong> Well I&rsquo;d agree mostly about not wanting to put a bunch of validation attributes on domain objects. BUT! Like Joe, I too have been applying the &ldquo;replace unnecessary complexity wth simplification&rdquo; refactoring to myself for a while now. (Hmm, refactoring <em>yourself</em>, smells like a blog post&mldr;) :) And it&rsquo;s all the Castle project&rsquo;s fault when I saw the simplicity of how quickly you could get a decently designed web app up and running using MonoRail + ActiveRecord. Now that I&rsquo;m digging into RoR, it&rsquo;s like that whole Castle MR + AR experience all over again, but this time it&rsquo;s like X 10. There really is just something beautiful about having lines like this in your domain object: <code>validates_presence_of :title validates_numericality_of :quantity</code> especially when you can constrain them like this: <code>validates_presence_of :title :on => :create</code> I dunno. It&rsquo;s definitely starting to grow on me. And I have a feeling that an Active Record implementation in a dynamic language is completely different than in a static language when it comes corrupting your design. But, I&rsquo;m still learning&mldr; (Sorry this kinda turned into a AR comment, but is kinda along the same lines&mldr;)</p><p><strong><a href=#133 title="2008-03-05 12:04:29">deman</a>:</strong> Jason, I&rsquo;m waiting for your authentication post. Or did I miss it somewhere? Thank you.</p><p><strong><a href=#134 title="2008-10-23 15:09:54">Isidro</a>:</strong> I&rsquo;m having troubles with regex validations. If I put any kind of regexes in the validators the validation stops working! Is this a know issue?</p><p><strong><a href=#135 title="2008-10-28 12:11:28">Jason Meridth</a>:</strong> @ isidro Whenever that happens to me, it isn&rsquo;t the Monorail Validator, it&rsquo;s my regex. I use Roy Osherove&rsquo;s Regulator tool to test my regex queries and that usually straightens me out. Hope this helps.</p></div></div></article></div></main><footer>© Copyright notice | <a href=https://github.com/dataCobra/hugo-vitae target=_blank>Vitae</a> theme for <a href=https://gohugo.io target=_blank>Hugo</a>
