What you want, how you do it and the way you (and also the person who is commisioning you to write your code) do it is almost certainly not the way the end user wants to do it. And unless you speak to them and watch them you will never know.&rdquo;</em></p></blockquote></div></div></article></div></main><footer>© Copyright notice | <a href=https://github.com/dataCobra/hugo-vitae target=_blank>Vitae</a> theme for <a href=https://gohugo.io target=_blank>Hugo</a></footer><script src=/js/dark-mode.js></script></body></html>
