   2: public void X()


   3: {


   4:


   5: }
</code></pre><p>After making the test fail, I rename it to this (say this test was in the context of a US citizen having a passport):</p><pre><code>   1: [Test]


   2: public void should_be_able_to_travel_abroad()


   3: {


   4:


   5: }
</code></pre><p>I usually write my test and my assertions, just to &ldquo;do the simplest thing to get it to work&rdquo;.  I apply that philosophy to TDD too.  I want to do the simplest thing to get through Red-Green-Refactor.  I&rsquo;ve paired with developers &ndash; and have been guilty of this in the past too &ndash; that spend more time on thinking of the test method name or the class context name instead of writing code.  It&rsquo;s a test in the first place, right?  I&rsquo;m not &ldquo;Joshing&rdquo; the method-naming-first developers.  I can appreciate the fact that this is a personal choice.  I also expect to be asked, &ldquo;how can you write your test if you don&rsquo;t know what you are going to test?&rdquo;  My answer is, &ldquo;I let the code tell me and I just want fingertips on the keyboard&rdquo;.  Hell, that is what F2 (Rename in ReSharper) is for.  I rename my method and context (TestFixture class name) accordingly after I see Red.  If upon passing and refactoring the test, the name needs to change again, hit F2.</p><p>What are your thoughts?</p><h2 id=comments>Comments</h2><p><strong><a href=#214 title="2008-02-10 16:14:46">Chris Patterson</a>:</strong> A good way to break the log jam in naming your tests is to look at the acceptance criteria of the story you are developing. - When the passenger is traveling to another country, they must have a passport. public class When_the_passenger_is_traveling_to_another_country() { [Test] public void They_must_have_a_passport() { } } Just an example I know, but it makes sense if you start from a well defined story with solid acceptance criteria.</p><p><strong><a href=#215 title="2008-02-11 14:10:28">Christopher Bennage</a>:</strong> I pretty much do the same thing as you Jason. I care a lot about names, but I was wasting a lot of time naming things up front. Now, I either &lsquo;X&rsquo; or best guess and take solace in the fact that I can easily F2 it as soon as I know more.</p><p><strong><a href=#216 title="2008-02-11 18:19:38">joeyDotNet</a>:</strong> The only thing you don&rsquo;t get with F2 is the ability to easily create a sentence like test name by actually writing a sentence. At least not as easily. One of my R# live templates (nt) is for creating a new test which looks like this: [Test] public void &ldquo;TESTNAME&rdquo;() { } With the TESTNAME part highlighted so I can just start typing a sentence including spaces. Then a short Alt-S + Alt-U later (spaces to underscores) I&rsquo;m in business&mldr;using a tweaked version of the BDD macro that JP, Scott, Joe and others have showed. Might seem like a small thing, but I&rsquo;ve found it speeds me up. And of course you can always F2 it later if you need to change it.</p></div></div></article></div></main><footer>© Copyright notice | <a href=https://github.com/dataCobra/hugo-vitae target=_blank>Vitae</a> theme for <a href=https://gohugo.io target=_blank>Hugo</a></footer><script src=/js/dark-mode.js></script></body></html>
