  Finally. Yeah, it got delayed, not because of any huge issues, but because of various bugfixes trickling in and causing me to reset my &lsquo;release clock&rsquo; all the time. But it&rsquo;s out there now, and hopefully better for the wait," Linus Torvalds said announcing the 2.6.23 kernel. He noted few changes since the last release candidate, &ldquo;not a whole lot of changes since -rc9, although there&rsquo;s a few updates to mips, sparc64 and blackfin in there. Ignoring those arch updates, there&rsquo;s basically a number of mostly one-liners (mostly in drivers, but there&rsquo;s some networking fixes and soem VFS/VM fixes there too).&rdquo; Source level changes can be viewed via the gitweb interface. A nice overview of all changes can be found at Kernel Newbies. Linus went on to describe his plan going forward
