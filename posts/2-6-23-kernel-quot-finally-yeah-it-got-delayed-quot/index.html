Finally.

Yeah, it got delayed, not because of any huge issues, but because of
various bugfixes trickling in and causing me to reset my &quot;release clock&quot;
all the time. But it's out there now, and hopefully better for the wait.

Not a whole lot of changes since -rc9, although there's a few updates to
mips, sparc64 and blackfin in there.  Ignoring those arch updates, there's
basically a number of mostly one-liners (mostly in drivers, but there's
some networking fixes and soem VFS/VM fixes there too).

Shortlog and diffstat appended (both relative to -rc9, of course - the
full log from 2.6.22 is on kernel.org as usual).

I want this to be what people look at for a few days, but expect the x86
merge to go ahead after that. So far, all indications are still that it's
going to be all smooth sailing, but hey, those indicators seem to always
say that, and only after the fact do people notice any problems ;)
