It is a very good introduction to TDD, NHibernate, DDD, NUnit.

I'm personally trying to learn NHibernate.  I already practice the other items at my current position.

[Ayende mentions](http://www.ayende.com/Blog/HowToGetStartedWithNHibernate.aspx) the above blog and others to help a developer get started with NHibernate.

**[Chris Patterson](#2 "2007-11-15 14:41:27"):** I really would like to see Ben roll this up into a PDF I can read on the toilet. I think it is a great series.
