I’ve read a good number of Agile process and management books. I’m partial to the Pragmatic Programmer publishers due to their consistently well-written books. I also started using stickies instead of pens/pencils when I read my books. Mainly because they stand out better and allow me to find my notes quicker.

The stickies I use are <a href=http://www.3m.com/us/office/postit/products/prod_ft_pgm.html class=external-link target=_blank rel=noopener>these</a> and can be found at most office stores.</p><p>Anyways, back to the book. The authors, Rachel Davies and Liz Sedley, do a good job explaining the different ways to start/continue agile coaching. The format of the book, multiple sections relevant to the chapter, Hurdles, and Checklist, worked very well for me. They share their experience, pain points, and give you a list that you can contain in your short-term memory.</p><p>I enjoyed reading this book because it made me, once again, focus more on the people aspect of software development and less on the coding. I haven’t focused much on that part because I’ve assumed the people I work with are all professionals. Unfortunately, I’ve forgotten that they are human, too and need to be approached as humans and not machines. I’m still convinced that all software developers are control freaks. Our computer does what we tell it to. If it doesn’t, it is usually our fault.</p><p>I highly recommend this book.</p><h1 id=notes>NOTES

Make time in iteration plans for them to explore new ideas. This can do wonders for motivation—and for the product.</li></ul><p>Teams Aren’t Cross-Functional</p><ul><li>Some companies organize teams by discipline, such as analysts, designers, testsers, software engineers, and so on, with separate reporting lines. This is a serious blocker to becoming Agile because a fundamental Agile principle is cross-functional teams with different disciplines working together to build the best software.</li></ul><p>—</p><h2 id=chapter-5--daily-standup>Chapter 5 – Daily Standup

The daily standup is for you all to work out what you need to do today, not me”. Worst case: do not attend the daily standup at all</li><li>Avoid giving praise during the stand-up, again to avoid focus of work and responses on you</li></ul><p>Handling Issues</p><ul><li>Parking lot of issues on the whiteboard</li></ul><p>Forget the Formula</p><ul><li>Don’t let the rules, which are there to help you get started, become a straightjacket once you are more established.</li><li>Don’t let the stand-ups/scrum lose it’s meaning</li></ul><p>Hurdle: Dail Standup Isn’t Wanted</p><ul><li>…if the whole team objects to the daily standups, you have a more serious problem on your hands. It is possible that they’re struggling to work as a team or that the meetings are being badly run. We suggest you discuss their concerns in the retrospective.</li></ul><p>—</p><h2 id=chapter-6--understanding-what-to-build>Chapter 6 – Understanding What to Build
