_Update: MEF == Managed Extensibility Framework_

Read [here](http://hammett.castleproject.org/?p=312#comment-62594).  I couldn't believe until I read it.  He will be a Program Manager for MEF (Microsoft Entity Framework, I'm assuming?).  This is a VERY good thing.

**[Sean Chambers](#277 "2008-07-16 11:05:47"):** wow. my jaw literally hit the ground when I read this. Looks like they're pulling out the big guns. Definately a good thing though as you stated. I wonder if they will only allow him to blog about the entity framework and not his open source project anymore like other recently hired MS employees? Probably not the case, but I saw an opportunity to make a stab =)

**[Derick Bailey](#278 "2008-07-16 19:58:18"):** MEF = Managed Extensibility Framework, not "entity framework". http://code.msdn.microsoft.com/mef I hope Castle does not fall by the wayside with him moving into the MS realm.
