CI == Continous Integration
I personally enjoy watching a team hear the Mortal Kombat voice yell “Fatality” when a build fails and see them all go to the web dashboard, be it CruiseControl.NET or TeamCity, and watch one of them say out loud what the problem was and claim the task of fixing it or checking with the developer who did the last check-in and give them a chance to fix it."><meta property="og:locale" content="en_us"><meta property="og:type" content="article"><meta property="article:section" content="posts"><meta property="article:published_time" content="2009-01-16T04:08:00-06:00"><meta property="article:modified_time" content="2022-02-15T20:12:38-06:00"><meta name=twitter:card content="summary"><meta name=twitter:title content="Personal CI history and Hudson CI as service on Ubuntu/Debian"><meta name=twitter:description content="UPDATE: CruiseControl.rb does have Git support fromgit://github.com/benburkert/cruisecontrolrb.git.

1. Using the Git plugin on windows right now, doesn&rsquo;t work.  The 0.5 version adds a forward slash in from of the C:PATH_TO_CLONE_REPO path when trying to clone a repository.  The 0.6 development branch has the fix for this but I could not find a nightly build or downloadable area.  I then moved to a Linux slice on my slicehost account and installed Hudson.  Again, in under 30 minutes.</p><p>On the new Linux slice I was able to add the Git, Rake, Ruby, Ruby Metrics plugins and have no issues.  Of course the catch with Linux there is no link on the Web UI to setup a service you could start and stop like &ldquo;sudo /etc/init.d/hudson stop|start&rdquo;.  <a href=http://weblogs.java.net/blog/johnsmart/archive/2008/10/installing_huds.html target=_blank>This link</a> does an excellent job on how to setup that service (ON UBUNTU/DEBIAN KEEP READING BEFORE CLICKING LINK).  On a debian/ubuntu install the only difference is that you&rsquo;ll want to remove the following lines from the /etc/init.d/hudson file:</p><h1 id=source-function-library--etcrcdinitdfunctions--get-config--etcsysconfignetwork>Source function library . /etc/rc.d/init.d/functions # Get config. . /etc/sysconfig/network</h1><p>I&rsquo;m still researching how to do this on a Debian/Ubuntu install (probably really easy, I just haven&rsquo;t looked). Once I find it, I&rsquo;ll update this post.</p><p>Instead of running the last command:</p><p>chkconfig &ndash;add hudson</p><p>which is Redhat specific, you need to run the following to ensure that your script is put into the default runlevels and you know that the script will start on bootup:</p><p>update-rc.d hudson default</p><p>Hope this helps someone out there.  This is also for me in case I need to setup another Hudson service on a Linux box.</p><p>Thanks to <a href=http://weblogs.java.net/blog/johnsmart/ target=_blank>John Ferguson</a> for doing most of the hard work and writing the blog entry for RedHat.</p><p>I&rsquo;ll keep you guys posted on how I get my projects running and going.  So far I have one running great, but it&rsquo;s only running a few specs.</p><h2 id=comments>Comments</h2><p><strong><a href=#385 title="2009-01-16 07:51:09">Jeremy Lightsmith</a>:</strong> Cruise Control.rb DOES have support for git. It&rsquo;s not been released yet, but if you use the development head from github, it&rsquo;s quite stable and close to release.</p></div></div></article></div></main><footer>© Copyright notice | <a href=https://github.com/dataCobra/hugo-vitae target=_blank>Vitae</a> theme for <a href=https://gohugo.io target=_blank>Hugo</a></footer><script src=/js/dark-mode.js></script></body></html>
