Slashdot has posted a new [article](http://developers.slashdot.org/article.pl%3fsid%3d07/01/01/2041256%26from%3drss) about the D programming language.

From the article:

For those with a C/C++ background, D offers: 

  * native code speed 
  * extremely fast compilation times 
  * garbage collection (although you can manage your own memory if you want) 
  * OOP - by reference only, easy initialization, always virtual 
  * cleaner template metaprogramming syntax, more powerful templates, as well 
  * built-in dynamic and associative arrays, array slicing 
  * versioning (no preprocessor madness) 
  * link-compatibility with C 
  * nested functions 
  * class delegates / function pointers 
  * module system 

For those with a C#/Java background (a shorter list, but one with big wins): 

  * similar syntax 
  * No virtual machine or interpreter 
  * built-in unit testing and design-by-contract 

These two [comparison](http://www.prowiki.org/wiki4d/wiki.cgi%3fLanguagesVersusD) [sheets](http://www.digitalmars.com/d/comparison.html) can go into more depth on how D stacks up against other languages.  
  
From D's creator:  
For me, it's hard to pinpoint any particular feature or two. It's the combination of features that makes the cake, not the sugar, flour or baking powder. So, 

  1. My programs come together faster and have fewer bugs. 
  2. Once written, the programs are easier to modify. 
  3. I can do (1) and (2) without giving up performance.
