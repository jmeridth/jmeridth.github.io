Same happened to me.</p><p><strong><a href=#43 title="2008-01-14 16:22:12">Gaz Murphy</a>:</strong> Well Guys, I&rsquo;ll be running ntfsfix on a laptop in the morning, I hope it works for me as well. Got some user data to retrieve&mldr;</p><p><strong><a href=#44 title="2008-05-02 23:40:11">Mike</a>:</strong> Well &mldr; ntfsfix worked for me, too. I thought it was a bad disk. Win2K said it couldn&rsquo;t find the boot volume. I booted with the knoppix cd to see whether the machine was fried. Came up fine, so I decided to mount the windoze partition. Couldn&rsquo;t, but suggested running ntfsfix. Then, I could mount it. So, I rebooted into Win2K. It ran a check and booted fine. I&rsquo;m still amazed!</p><p><strong><a href=#45 title="2008-08-02 13:48:55">T</a>:</strong> linux saved my a$$ on more than one occasions :p It works ! and no catch :D</p></div><footer></footer></article></section></div><footer class=footer><section class=container>©
