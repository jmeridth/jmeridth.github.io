It&rsquo;s a centralized way of remembering what books you own.</p><p>Yes, <a href=http://safari.oreilly.com class=external-link target=_blank rel=noopener>Safari Books Online</a> is freaking awesome, but sometimes a normal book is what is needed.  I know I can&rsquo;t study with Safari (personal opinion).  I use it more as a reference.</p><p>Check out my library <a href=http://www.librarything.com/profile/jmeridth class=external-link target=_blank rel=noopener>here</a>.</p><p><em><strong>Special Note: They are in Beta and are a growing website.  If the visitor load gets to big sometimes, you can&rsquo;t view catalogs without signing in.</strong></em></p><h2 id=comments>Comments

<span class=sr-only>Link to heading</span></a></h2><p><strong><a href=#308 title="2008-11-27 21:45:42">Matt D.</a>:</strong> Also a cool program &ndash; <a href=http://www.delicious-monster.com/ class=external-link target=_blank rel=noopener>Delicious Library</a> I got a license via MacHeist, and while it&rsquo;s not exactly what you&rsquo;re saying, it lets you keep a catalog of all of your books, movies and games and uses AWS to give you up to tdate information (and download cover/case art) for each and displays them on a virtual shelf.</p><p><strong><a href=#309 title="2008-11-27 22:24:20">Jason Meridth</a>:</strong> @Matt D. Awesome. Looks very cool. I prefer free tools that run on the web, like delicious.com for bookmarks, etc. Mainly because I&rsquo;m cheap. :) I actually have a Mac Book Pro, so I&rsquo;ll definitely check it out.</p><p><strong><a href=#310 title="2008-12-03 15:19:57">James W.</a>:</strong> You should also check out <a href=http://www.shelfari.com class=external-link target=_blank rel=noopener>http://www.shelfari.com</a></p></div><footer></footer></article></section></div><footer class=footer><section class=container>©
