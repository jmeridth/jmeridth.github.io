I just recently found out about this, and may be late on the band wagon, but you can download the ReSharper 4.0 nightly builds for free.  They last ~15 days, so you will have to uninstall the build you have and then install a more recent nightly build.

[Get the builds here](http://www.jetbrains.net/confluence/display/ReSharper/ReSharper+4.0+Nightly+Builds).

JetBrains does not guarantee any of the builds, but I have yet to find any issues with the current keystrokes that I use.
