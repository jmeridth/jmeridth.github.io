My 2GB USB key drive has been bent for about 1 week so I almost bought a 4GB at Fry&rsquo;s last weekend for $89.  I hesitated and it&rsquo;s a good thing.  I went to CompUSA today and saw that they were selling 4GB SanDisk Cruzers for $39.  I went and got one.  To re-iterate what <a href=http://www.jeffreypalermo.com class=external-link target=_blank rel=noopener>Jeffrey Palermo</a> <a href=http://codebetter.com/blogs/jeffrey.palermo/archive/2007/06/25/modify-and-restore-firefox-extensions-that-fail-to-load.aspx class=external-link target=_blank rel=noopener>said</a>, I loaded the <a href=http://portableapps.com/ class=external-link target=_blank rel=noopener>PortableApps</a> suite.</p><p>2. While I was there I got a 300 Watt ATX power supply for my home server.  It went out about 2 months ago and I haven&rsquo;t need the box until recently.  I replaced the power supply and was able to access my home server once again.</p><p>3. I finished the chapter &ldquo;Framework for integration tests: Beauty Through Fragility&rdquo; in the &ldquo;Beautiful Code&rdquo; book.  I started it at 9am this morning and finished it.  (Please be aware that I have a 2 year old and a dirty house, cleaning and playing with my son were part of the day too).</p><p>4. I also reloaded my first Mac.  One of my wife&rsquo;s co-workers has a G4 powerbook and it would boot up and then just sit on the apple screen.  I had to learn how to boot to CD first (hold down the letter &ldquo;c&rdquo; when the laptop is turned on).  Once the restore CD boots, it will boot straight to a reinstall screen.  It looks a lot like a Linux live CD; it had the look of the normal Mac desktop.  Throughout the file menu there was an option to scan the hard disk and repair if there were any errors.  It failed.  I formatted from that very same tool (all GUI) and then started the reload.  It worked and the laptop is ready to go.</p><p>For all the non-Mac people out there:  to right-click, all you have to do is hold down the &ldquo;ctrl&rdquo; key when you click the mouse button. :)</p><p>5.  I finally posted my next to last ALT.net conference summation post, my last one is coming soon.</p><p>6. I wired-up the email sender for my personal MonoRail site.  This was after trying to write the unit test.  I finally succeeded and it was VERY easy with BaseControllerTest involved.  I&rsquo;ll explain in my next MonoRail post.</p><p>A nerdy afternoon/evening.  A good one.</p></div><footer></footer></article></section></div><footer class=footer><section class=container>©
