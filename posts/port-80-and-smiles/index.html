<span class=sr-only>Link to heading</span></a></h2><p><strong><a href=#206 title="2007-11-14 06:39:46">Chris Brandsma</a>:</strong> Must be a LINQ to SQL thing. I had my last presentation (an msdn event) blow up as well. My laptop even blue screened. <a href=http://www.chrisbrandsma.com/2007/10/msdn-presentation-and-demo-gods.html class=external-link target=_blank rel=noopener>http://www.chrisbrandsma.com/2007/10/msdn-presentation-and-demo-gods.html</a> But, it isn&rsquo;t about what goes wrong, but how you recover.</p><p><strong><a href=#207 title="2007-11-14 17:12:52">jlockwood</a>:</strong> @Jason - You did fine, don&rsquo;t beat yourself up over it. I ran into the guy that came from SAWS last night and he said it was really informative. He was afraid some of the material would be over his head, but he said the material was presented clearly and he learned a lot. Mission&mldr;success. @Chris - &ldquo;My laptop even blue screened&rdquo;&mldr;I call that getting Bill Gated (referring to an XP/PlugNPlay demo). I may go through numerous man hours (man days even) using a technology without any issues but then those nasty gremlins always seem to rear their little heads during presentations. They rarely fail me in that respect. ;)</p></div><footer></footer></article></section></div><footer class=footer><section class=container>©
