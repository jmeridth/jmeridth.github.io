How old were you when you started programming?
I was 11 years old (6th grade) when I started using QBasic to make easy games. I actually knew about the easter egg that showed the developer names.
What was your first language?
Like Joey I used to write basic apps with QBasic and even mimicked a Windows Blue screen for fun. I also used to code my TI calculators for games when I was bored.">

<p><strong>How old were you when you started programming?</strong></p>
<p>I was 11 years old (6th grade) when I started using QBasic to make easy games.  I actually knew about the easter egg that showed the developer names.</p>
<p><strong>What was your first language?</strong></p>
<p>Like Joey I used to write basic apps with QBasic and even mimicked a Windows Blue screen for fun.  I also used to code my TI calculators for games  when I was bored.  Pascal was my first third generation language for school and then hopped to ANSI C and C++.  Java and C# followed.  Python and Ruby are my new study items.****</p>
<p><strong>What was the first real program you wrote?</strong></p>
<p>Mentioned above .  It was games written in QBasic.  For friends and family.****</p>
<p><strong>If you knew then what you know now, would you have started programming?</strong></p>
<p>Most definitely.  This is one of those industries where you get to learn about other industries.  You get this because you write software for them. :)</p>
<p><strong>If there is one thing you learned along the way that you would tell new developers, what would it be?</strong></p>
<p>The easiest answer is to go read &ldquo;Pragmatic Programmer&rdquo; by Hunt and Thomas, then go pair program with someone with Agile (Scrum/XP) experience.  I&rsquo;m not trying to start an Agile flame war, but in my personal experience it works.</p>
<p><strong>What&rsquo;s the most fun you&rsquo;ve ever had &mldr; programming?</strong></p>
<p>The current team I&rsquo;m on successfully wrote an internal web app for our mortgage company, with 6000+ unit tests, pair programming, continuous integration, and other little goodies.  The best part: project finished ahead of schedule, under budget, with zero defects, and a VERY happy end user.  That is fun.  Lasted almost a year.</p>
