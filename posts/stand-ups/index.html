1. Development
2. Systems
3. Business</li><li>Production Support (usually 1 infrastructure team member and 1 developer)</li><li>Build Status  (Iteration and Release updates)
1. Development
2. Systems
3. Business</li><li>Administrative Items (managers)</li></ol><p>This has worked out really well to enlighten everyone in all groups.  Does anyone have something similar or close?</p><p>After that session, which ends usually around 9:10-9:15, then we have individual group stand-ups.</p><p>For the developers group we do the age-old list:</p><ol><li>What did you work on the previous business day?</li><li>What are you currently working on or will work on?</li><li>Do you have any obstacles or pending information inquiries directed to the domain experts?</li></ol><p>This has also worked out really well.</p><p>When we started the developer stand-ups they would drag out due to other developers asking questions and other such things and we would lose track of time.  Joe (<a href=http://www.lostechies.com/blogs/joe_ocampo class=external-link target=_blank rel=noopener>agilejoe</a>), my manager agile coach, decided to use cooking timers.  Each developer has ~1 minute to answer the 3 questions above.  Timer goes off or you are done, then you pass the timer on.</p><p>What does everyone else do?  Remember, we are in a &ldquo;corporate&rdquo; XP/Scrum environment and this has been our &ldquo;solution&rdquo;.</p><h2 id=comments>Comments

LOL</p><p><strong><a href=#152 title="2007-10-05 01:12:31">Christopher Bennage</a>:</strong> I heard a spot on NPR a few years back that suggested we do away with the term Boss, because a boss is someone big baddy you have to fight at the end of a level. They recommended the label Strategy Guide. This really only applies to those of us who grew up on video games.</p></div><footer></footer></article></section></div><footer class=footer><section class=container>©
