<span class=sr-only>Link to heading</span></a></h2><p><strong><a href=#238 title="2008-04-28 13:06:51">JLangbridge</a>:</strong> Works great! I still had a slight problem afterwards, I needed to add myself to the usbfs group, etc, but that is easily done. Many thanks!</p><p><strong><a href=#239 title="2008-04-30 20:09:56">Dan Delaney</a>:</strong> Odd. I did this. It installed fine. It runs. But then when I bring up the settings for my virtual machine I get this: Could not load the Host USB Proxy Service (VERR_FILE_NOT_FOUND)</p><p><strong><a href=#240 title="2008-04-30 21:50:52">Jason Meridth</a>:</strong> @Dan Look here: <a href=http://paulsiu.wordpress.com/2007/11/20/tips-on-running-innotek-virtualbox/ class=external-link target=_blank rel=noopener>http://paulsiu.wordpress.com/2007/11/20/tips-on-running-innotek-virtualbox/</a> It looks like you just need to edit the /etc/init.d/mountdevsubfs.sh file by uncommenting the commented lines. You also have to grant some permissions shown in the post. I didn&rsquo;t have this issue, but it seems to be related to the same thing that JLangbridge had. Thanks.</p><p><strong><a href=#241 title="2008-05-01 18:13:17">taurusx5</a>:</strong> Presently, i have virtualbox installed on my ubuntu 7.10. however, i want to uprade to 8.04. will upgrading to 8.04 adversely affect my virtualbox? will upgrading also affect my opera broswer already installed also?</p><p><strong><a href=#242 title="2008-05-02 03:41:43">Jason Meridth</a>:</strong> @taurusx5 when prompted to upgrade your virtualbox install during upgrade, say NO. I don&rsquo;t know about Opera. I&rsquo;m a Firefox guy. I&rsquo;m enjoying the Firefox 3 Beta 5 install that is default with 8.04. If you do decide to upgrade, please let me know about Opera.</p><p><strong><a href=#243 title="2008-05-10 14:19:08">taurusx5</a>:</strong> jason, thanks for the comment. however, one thing i didn&rsquo;t tell you is that i have the closed source edition of virtualbox. i therefore have 3 questions for you: 1) will upgrading to 8.04 affect my closed source edition of virtualbox in any way? 2) will upgrading to 8.04 affect USB support in virtualbox? 3) will upgrading to 8.04 affect the user group?</p><p><strong><a href=#244 title="2008-05-11 16:17:45">taurusx5</a>:</strong> Jason, one more question that I forgot to ask was, will upgrading to 8.04 affect guest additions in virtualbox cse. And please disregard question #3 of my previous post. Thanks.</p><p><strong><a href=#245 title="2008-05-11 17:44:54">Jason Meridth</a>:</strong> @taurusx5 You ask excellent questions. My current answer is &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know&rdquo;. I am researching now. Keep&rsquo;em coming.</p><p><strong><a href=#246 title="2008-05-15 21:23:41">taurusx5</a>:</strong> hi, jason. hope that you can soon answer my questions regarding my virtualbox cse. i&rsquo;m really desperate about upgrading to the latest 8.04, but of course, my concern for virtualbox stability after upgrade takes precedence. hope you understand&mldr; thanks!</p><p><strong><a href=#247 title="2008-05-19 20:58:06">Jason Meridth</a>:</strong> @taurusx5 i followed gusman21&rsquo;s response to your post on ubuntuforms (<a href="http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?p=4971770" class=external-link target=_blank rel=noopener>http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?p=4971770</a>) and it worked for me. Hope this helps. Sorry for the delay, I&rsquo;ve been under the weather.</p><p><strong><a href=#248 title="2008-05-22 00:28:48">taurusx5</a>:</strong> Jason, thanks for the info&mldr; I will be upgrading to 8.04 soon and I will modify code for USB access thereafter. Thanks man!</p><p><strong><a href=#249 title="2008-06-27 20:44:12">ryba</a>:</strong> jesli ktos bedzie mial problem z virtualboxem i postawieniem na nim windowsa to chetnie pomoge, moj gg 8009121,a jesli chodzi o sam system to w moim przypadku byl to najlepszy wybor jakiego dokonalem,ubuntu posiada wszystko co jest potrzebne a jesli nie dziala to po VB mozna otworzyc badz w WINE,bardzopolacam kazdemu kto ma dosc ciaglych problemow z windowsem i szukania seriali do programow hehe,ubunto oferuje to samo i w pelni legalnie.</p><p><strong><a href=#250 title="2008-06-27 21:04:39">Jason Meridth</a>:</strong> @ryba I apologize. I&rsquo;m not able to translate. Through quick research, this seems to be Hungarian? If you can translate to English, I&rsquo;ll respond to any questions or concerns. I do see WINE and VB mentioned. I&rsquo;ve use WINE to run games on my Linux boxes.</p><p><strong><a href=#251 title="2008-07-09 03:07:02">taurusx5</a>:</strong> Hi, Jason! It&rsquo;s been a while! Hope you remember me as the guy who was skeptical about upgrading to ubuntu 8.04 in relation to virtualbox - I still got cold feet so I&rsquo;m staying with 7.10&mldr;. Anyway, I got a question for you&mldr; I downloaded a folder icon with a .png extension and I want to make that my default folder icon throughout my ubuntu 7.10. What must I do for that? Also, I want to do the same thing to tar files - I want to change the icon for tar.bz2 and tar.gz files throughtout my system. What must I do?</p><p><strong><a href=#252 title="2008-07-09 05:24:42">Jason Meridth</a>:</strong> @taurusx5 welcome back. check this out: <a href=https://answers.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+question/38588 class=external-link target=_blank rel=noopener>https://answers.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+question/38588</a> It worked for me. Hadn&rsquo;t thought about doing this, but definitely good to know. Hope it helps. If it doesn&rsquo;t work, please let me know.</p><p><strong><a href=#253 title="2008-07-10 00:06:19">taurusx5</a>:</strong> Jason, actually, the post you provided was started by me. Ha ha&mldr; That&rsquo;s ok. One of the repliers on it had recommended that I open up nautilus and then substitute the icon in usr/share/icons. But, he cautions that the icon must be the same size as the icon I&rsquo;m substituting. I see many folders in there and in particular, there are folders denoted with 22x22, 24x24, 32x32, etc. Which would be the right one? I don&rsquo;t want to mess up my system if something should go wrong. Thanks, Jason!</p><p><strong><a href=#254 title="2008-07-10 02:20:40">Jason Meridth</a>:</strong> LOL. Now that&rsquo;s funny. I&rsquo;ll play with it a bit, I&rsquo;m willing to crash mine :) I like to learn, everything important is on my Gutsy Server. Wife is 8 1/2 months pregnant, so give me a little bit of time on this one, please.</p><p><strong><a href=#255 title="2008-07-11 21:46:21">taurusx5</a>:</strong> Hey, Jason. Actually, I went ahead and installed an icon theme. This was getting frustrating for me. And, sorry about giving you a headache over my little icon issue. However, I got a question regarding this. How can I change icons for files like, doc, mp3, zip, mov, openoffice files, etc. I just don&rsquo;t want to simply change an individual icon on my desktop. I want to make changes globally. Must must I do? And thanks so much so far for all your needed help!</p><p><strong><a href=#256 title="2008-07-17 12:19:39">Jason Meridth</a>:</strong> @taurusx5 I&rsquo;m sorry for the delay. I started my new job this week and my wife is about to have our baby. I&rsquo;ll try to get you an answer ASAP.

Hope you and the wife are doing well. I got a question. My Ubuntu 7.10 has been running slow lately. I&rsquo;ve deleted stuff in my trash but it&rsquo;s still running slow. Are there any management tools I can download to make Ubuntu run more efficiently and faster? Sort of like, XP&rsquo;s defragmentor? Also, I checked my CPU usage and found that the plugin for Opera is running 80% of my CPU usage. Any ideas?</p><p><strong><a href=#260 title="2008-07-29 22:14:58">taurusx5</a>:</strong> Hi Jason! Oh WOW, Jason&mldr; I really need your help now!!! I know you and the misses are expecting a child soon so I don&rsquo;t mean to disrupt that, but when you have time, please help me with this problem! OK, I was having a problem booting up my computer. I&rsquo;d get an error stating: &ldquo;The computer clock appears to be wrong. The session might encounter issues if the computer clock is not properly configured. Please consider adjusting it. Curredate is 01/01/1988.&rdquo; It was then suggested that I replace the CMOS battery with a new one, chich I did. I then entered &lsquo;date&rsquo; and &lsquo;hwclock&rsquo; in terminal to see if the system is in sync. Obviously, they&rsquo;re not according to the output below. x@xx:date Tue Jul 29 19:45:34 EDT 2008 x@xx:~$ hwclock Thu 31 Dec 1987 07:46:26 PM EST -0.606672 seconds This is driving me crazy!

Thanks, Jason!</p><p><strong><a href=#261 title="2008-07-29 22:38:07">Jason Meridth</a>:</strong> Have you set the hardware time in the BIOS? Usually pressing delete or F2 at boot of the PC. Stupid question, I know. I&rsquo;ll look into this later. I apologize, we had our baby boy on Friday. <a href=http://www.bishopmeridth.com class=external-link target=_blank rel=noopener>http://www.bishopmeridth.com</a></p><p><strong><a href=#262 title="2008-07-30 07:05:02">taurusx5</a>:</strong> Jason, your tip saved me!!!

I got a small problem I hope you can help me with. I recently upgraded to 8.04 and I can&rsquo;t install an icon theme that I actually installed under 7.10. Many users have complained about this also. Do you know of a way to install this and similar icon themes on 8.04? Thanks.</p><p><strong><a href=#264 title="2008-09-03 20:46:23">taurusx5</a>:</strong> Hi, Jason. Quick question for you&mldr; How do I turn services off in sysv-rc-conf so that the services don&rsquo;t boot up? I see the runlevels but I don&rsquo;t know whether or not I should uncheck all the runlevels. Please let me know. Thanks.</p><p><strong><a href=#265 title="2008-09-04 01:27:37">Jason Meridth</a>:</strong> @taurusx5 it looks like marcobra answered your question on the Ubuntu Launchpad site (<a href=https://answers.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/sysv-rc-conf/+question/43912 class=external-link target=_blank rel=noopener>https://answers.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/sysv-rc-conf/+question/43912</a>) I have no experience with this and will be reading/trying it out. Sorry I couldn&rsquo;t help.</p><p><strong><a href=#266 title="2008-09-08 09:57:50">taurusx5</a>:</strong> Jason, thanks for the reply. I got a small issue I hope you can help me with. My ubuntu 8.04 is slow. Whenever I open up docs or pdfs in openoffice writer or pdf reader, respectively, the scrolling is very slow. It was suggested by some that it has to do with reconfiguring my xserver since I&rsquo;m using generic drivers. Reconfiguring drivers specific to my video card would fix it. My question is, how do I reconfigure my xserver properly without putting my system at risk? Should I download these drivers? If so, which ones? Thanks, dude! .</p><p><strong><a href=#267 title="2008-09-19 14:29:54">XWIN</a>:</strong> Jason, I&rsquo;m running WinXP as a host, and 8.04 as a guest (Vbox 2.0.2). I&rsquo;m unable to get the guest 8.04 USB to work. I set both checkmarks on the VirtualBox settings GUI, for the 8.04 VM. I&rsquo;ve tried several other methods from blogs, but no success. Most people appear to run Ubuntu as the host, so I am having trouble finding the information for my host/guest configuration. Typically people blog, do this to fix USB, but which one is host/guest? Regards, Ray</p><p><strong><a href=#268 title="2008-09-19 14:40:53">Jason Meridth</a>:</strong> @XWIN in my case Ubuntu is my host and windows in my guest</p></div><footer></footer></article></section></div><footer class=footer><section class=container>©
