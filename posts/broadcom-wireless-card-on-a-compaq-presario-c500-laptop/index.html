I digress.</p><p>Anyways his Compaq Presario C500 laptop had Vista on it and it could see his printer but still couldn&rsquo;t print.  Same &lsquo;ol, same &lsquo;ol with there not being any Vista printer drivers ready. After an hour of looking for drivers I suggested Linux.  He had never heard of it.  I asked him if he trusted me and did he use any software that was specific to Windows.  He said yes to the first question and no to the second.</p><p>I took his laptop home and loaded Ubuntu 7.04 (Feisty Fawn).  No problems.  I copied off his photos from his My Docs folder to my USB key drive and then plugged it in and put back in his /home//photos folder after loading Ubuntu. I could not get the wireless card to work.  It detected the interface and I verified that it was in the /etc/network/interfaces file.  The wireless blue key on the main board of the laptop would not light up no matter was I tried.</p><p>I plugged in my CAT5 cable and updated the OS with the latest patches and also loaded Automatix 2.0.  Got RealPlayer and a few other software programs loaded he mentioned that he liked.</p><p>Now to the core of this post.</p><p>I tried the following fixes and they DID NOT work for me:</p><p>1. <a href="http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=405990" target=_blank>Ubuntu Forums Thread 405990</a>
