I had purchased the "[Agile Principles, Patterns, and Practices in C#](http://www.amazon.com/Principles-Patterns-Practices-Robert-Martin/dp/0131857258)" (PPP) book by [Robert C. Martin](http://www.butunclebob.com/ArticleS.UncleBob) (aka Uncle Bob) at the beginning of August 2006 and began reading it, but soon began to think that a lot of it's content was from the articles you can find on [Object Mentor's website](http://www.objectmentor.com/) (Uncle Bob's company).  I stopped reading it.  I have read most if not all those articles already.  I had intended to go back to the book and articles and compare the differences and have not.  
  
Object Mentor, mainly Michael Feathers (author of the VERY good book "[Working Effectively with Legacy Software](http://www.amazon.com/Working-Effectively-Legacy-Robert-Martin/dp/0131177052/sr%3d1-1/qid%3d1167361081/ref%3dsr_1_1/103-3245504-1239025%3fie%3dUTF8%26s%3dbooks)"), had visited the team that I'm currently about two years ago.  They had distributed mousepads that had the acronym SOLID on them.  
  
S = [Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)](http://www.objectmentor.com/resources/articles/srp.pdf)  
O = [Open/Closed Principle (OCP)](http://www.objectmentor.com/resources/articles/ocp.pdf)  
L = [Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)](http://www.objectmentor.com/resources/articles/lsp.pdf)  
I = [Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)](http://www.objectmentor.com/resources/articles/isp.pdf)  
D = [Dependency-Inversion Principle (DIP)](http://www.objectmentor.com/resources/articles/dip.pdf)  
 *Each link will go to the original articles on Object Mentor's site.  
  
Each one of these principle has it's own chapter in the PPP book.  
  
I have been racking my brain as to what ISP was.  I decided to pick up the book again tonight and have compared it to the article.  The book has made a GOOD number of additions/refactorings to the articles.   
  
I recommend the [PPP](http://www.amazon.com/Principles-Patterns-Practices-Robert-Martin/dp/0131857258) book to any developer who wants clean, testable, and extensible code.  
The book has much more information than just these OOP principles.
