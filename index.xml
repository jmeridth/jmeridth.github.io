If the project is hosted on GitHub, there is a helper URL for each repository that will highlight any issues that the maintainers have labelled with good first issue or help wanted.
that URL is /contribute on the the end of the repository URL. For example, the URL for the github.com/jmeridth/jmeridth.github.io repository is https://github.com/jmeridth/jmeridth.github.io/contribute

&lt;p>Howdy again.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In this post I&amp;rsquo;m going to show you how to create a docker image to run on ARM architecture and also how to deploy it and view it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To start please view my basic flask application called fl8 &lt;a href="https://github.com/meridth/fl8" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you&amp;rsquo;d like to clone and use it:&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" class="chroma">&lt;code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">&lt;span class="line">&lt;span class="cl">git clone git@github.com:meridth/fl8.git &lt;span class="o">&amp;amp;&amp;amp;&lt;/span> &lt;span class="nb">cd&lt;/span> fl8
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;h2 id="arm-docker-image">
 ARM docker image
 &lt;a class="heading-link" href="#arm-docker-image">
 &lt;i class="fa-solid fa-link" aria-hidden="true" title="Link to heading">&lt;/i>
 &lt;span class="sr-only">Link to heading&lt;/span>
 &lt;/a>
&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>First we need to learn about QEMU&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="what-is-qemu-and-qemu-installation">
 What is QEMU and QEMU installation
 &lt;a class="heading-link" href="#what-is-qemu-and-qemu-installation">

 &lt;span class="sr-only">Link to heading&lt;/span>
 &lt;/a>
&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>QEMU (Quick EMUlator) is an Open-Source hosted hypervisor, i.e. an hypervisor running on a OS just as other computer programs, which performs hardware virtualization. QEMU emulates CPUs of several architectures, e.g. x86, PPC, ARM and SPARC. It allows the execution of non-native target executables emulating the native execution and, as we require in this case, the cross-building process.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Raspberry Pi Kubernetes Cluster - Part 3</title><link>http://jmeridth.com/posts/raspberry-pi-kubernetes-cluster-part-3/</link><pubDate>Mon, 24 Dec 2018 15:59:23 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://jmeridth.com/posts/raspberry-pi-kubernetes-cluster-part-3/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;a href="http://jmeridth.com/posts/raspberry-pi-kubernetes-cluster-part-1" >Raspberry Pi Kubenetes Cluster - Part 1&lt;/a>&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Well, it took me long enough to follow up on my previous posts. There are reasons.&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>The day job has been fun and busy&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Family life has been fun and busy&lt;/li>
&lt;li>I kept hitting annoying errors when trying to get my cluster up and running&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>The first two reasons are the usual reasons a person doesn&amp;rsquo;t blog. :)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The last one is what prevented me from blogging sooner. I had mutliple issues when trying to use &lt;a href="https://rak8s.io" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rak8s&lt;/a> to setup my cluster. I&amp;rsquo;m a big fan of &lt;a href="https://ansible.com" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ansible&lt;/a> and I do not like running scripts over and over. I did read &lt;a href="https://gist.github.com/alexellis/fdbc90de7691a1b9edb545c17da2d975" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">K8S on Raspbian Lite&lt;/a> from top to bottom and realized automation would make this much better.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Raspberry Pi Kubernetes Cluster - Part 2</title><link>http://jmeridth.com/posts/raspberry-pi-kubernetes-cluster-part-2/</link><pubDate>Wed, 02 May 2018 21:13:07 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://jmeridth.com/posts/raspberry-pi-kubernetes-cluster-part-2/</guid><description>Edit: After fighting with Raspbian Lite, I decided to use HypriotOS as the base image on my Raspberry Pis.

&lt;p>Howdy&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This is going to be the first post about my setup of a Raspberry Pi Kubernetes Cluster. I saw a post by &lt;a href="https://harthoover.com/kubernetes-1.9-on-a-raspberry-pi-cluster/" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hart Hoover&lt;/a> and it finally motivated me to purchase his &amp;ldquo;grocery list&amp;rdquo; and do this finally. I&amp;rsquo;ve been using &lt;a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/getting-started-guides/minikube/" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Minikube&lt;/a> for local Kubernetes testing but it doesn&amp;rsquo;t give you multi-host testing abilities. I&amp;rsquo;ve also been wanting to get deeper into my Raspberry Pi knowledge. Lots of learning and winning.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>SSH - Too Many Authentication Failures</title><link>http://jmeridth.com/posts/ssh-too-many-authentication-failures/</link><pubDate>Wed, 28 Mar 2018 00:00:00 -0500</pubDate><guid>http://jmeridth.com/posts/ssh-too-many-authentication-failures/</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="problem">

I wrote my first program in the Basic programming language on an IBM PS/2 when I was eight years old (1988) and loved that I could control a computer and build software. In 1991 when QBasic came out I learned about the easter egg that you can do when starting QBasic from a DOS prompt.</description></item><item><title>Getting Going With Docker</title><link>http://jmeridth.com/posts/getting-going-with-docker/</link><pubDate>Tue, 22 Mar 2016 00:00:00 -0500</pubDate><guid>http://jmeridth.com/posts/getting-going-with-docker/</guid><description>UPDATE: Looks like this post is moot as of today 3/24/2016 due to Docker for Mac and Docker for Windows betas coming out

def role?(role) return !!self.roles.find_by_name(role.to_s.camelize) end Note the double exclamation (!!). This converts the value to boolean.
!! is just ! (the boolean negation operator) written twice. It will negate the argument, then negate the negation. It’s useful because you can use it to get a boolean from any value. The first ! will convert the argument to a boolean, e.g. true if it’s nil or false, and false otherwise.</description></item><item><title>Has And Belongs To Many Join Table Name Must Be In Alphabetical Order</title><link>http://jmeridth.com/posts/has-and-belongs-to-many-join-table-name-must-be-in-alphabetical-order/</link><pubDate>Sun, 03 Feb 2013 00:00:00 -0600</pubDate><guid>http://jmeridth.com/posts/has-and-belongs-to-many-join-table-name-must-be-in-alphabetical-order/</guid><description>TL;DR
Read this from the Rails Guides
Today I created an explicit join table between two models because each had has_and_belongs_to_many, as I’ve done many time before. Except, this time, when I tried to render one of my views, it said it couldn’t find a join table.
Example:
I created users_roles and the view error stated it was looking for roles_users.
Incorrect:
users_roles Correct:
roles_users My first inclination was the fact that it was looking for it in alphabetical order.</description></item><item><title>Create Rails Application in Current Directory</title><link>http://jmeridth.com/posts/create-rails-application-in-current-directory/</link><pubDate>Thu, 25 Oct 2012 00:00:00 -0500</pubDate><guid>http://jmeridth.com/posts/create-rails-application-in-current-directory/</guid><description>Yes, I know the common way to create a Rails application is

#!/bin/sh rake db:migrate rake db:test:prepare rake For non-rails developers, this will run any database migrations on my _development database, then ensure the_test database has the same schema, and then runs the tests.</description></item><item><title>Git Post-receive hook with integrity post call</title><link>http://jmeridth.com/posts/git-post-receive-hook-with-integrity-post-call/</link><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jul 2009 05:01:00 -0500</pubDate><guid>http://jmeridth.com/posts/git-post-receive-hook-with-integrity-post-call/</guid><description>Using the following code:

I just left a presentation by Scott Guthrie on the new ASP.NET MVC architecture and I&amp;rsquo;m impressed.
His opening slide was:
Principles: -Separation of concerns, unit testing, red/green TDD, maintainable -Extensible and pluggable -Enable clean urls and HTML -Integrate nicely within ASP.NET + .NET core code, support static + dynamic languages
Jeffrey Palermo, has a great post on it in more detail here.

Layouts are like master pages or template pages in Adobe DreamWeaver. They allow you to template your site. I have a default.vm under my ../Views/layouts folder and the way to make a controller utilize the layout is to add a layout attribute to the class definition:

What this allows a developer to do is extend types without needing to create a static service class. It is more like an extension class.
Example:
You want to add a method called IsValidEmailAddress to the base string class:
string email = Request.QueryString[&amp;ldquo;email&amp;rdquo;];
if ( email.IsValidEmailAddress() ) { }
You would create the following (the this keyword in the parameter list is the key)</description></item><item><title>Orcas - First try</title><link>http://jmeridth.com/posts/orcas-first-try/</link><pubDate>Fri, 23 Mar 2007 21:33:00 -0500</pubDate><guid>http://jmeridth.com/posts/orcas-first-try/</guid><description>After reading a post by Scott Guthrie on the new C# Orcas language features I decided to download Orcas and try them out. (excited)
The new features I practiced with and love are:
Object initializers Example: Prior to Orcas: Person person = new Person(); person.FirstName = &amp;ldquo;Scott&amp;rdquo;; person.LastName = &amp;ldquo;Guthrie&amp;rdquo;; person.Age = 32;
Orcas:
Person person = new Person { FirstName=&amp;ldquo;Scott&amp;rdquo;, LastName=&amp;ldquo;Guthrie&amp;rdquo;, Age=32 };
