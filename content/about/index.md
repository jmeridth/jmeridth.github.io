My name is JM (Jason Meridth).

I am a continually learning and accomplished software developer with passion in automation, open source, innersource, mentoring, developer tooling and security. I have experience in multiple software design life cycles, frameworks, languages, automation and orchestration technologies. I have experience in both start-up and enterprise environments. I also have experience as a Tech/Team Lead and Manager.

I reserve the right to change my mind upon obtaining more information.
