My name is Jason Meridth. At work I typically go by JM. I'm a father. I'm a nerd. I love [writing software](https://github.com/jmeridth). I tinker with hardware. A blog post I wrote a while ago talking about [my history in software development/programming](/posts/why-i-started-programming/).

Things that I'm currently passionate about:

- AI (both technical and ethical)
- Security and Privacy
- Supply Chain
- Automation
- Open Source (creation, maintenance, community, and usage)
- Cloud Native
- Mentoring

I am always learning and do my best to help others learn. I reserve the right to change my mind once I obtain new/different information. I try my best to `not let perfect be the enemy of good`.
