Update: I had to put this on hold due to a job switch and haven't studied any further or signed up for an exam again - 1/6/2015

I have decided to finally get the RHCSA and RHCE certifications.  RHCSA stands for Redhat Certified System Adminitrator and RHCE stands for Redhat Certified Engineer.  The reason I decided on these exams is for 2 reasons:

1. They are not multiple choice.  You sit at a kiosk with VNC and are given a live RHEL (Redhat Enterprise Linux) instance and are given issues to fix (aka Real World)
1. A stepping stone to me finally taking my Linux knowledge/skills seriously.

My current study guide:

Also my friend, [Major Hayden](https://major.io) suggested I look at the objectives list for each exame ([RHCSA objectives](http://www.redhat.com/en/files/resources/en-rhtr-ex200-rhel-6-exam-objectives-12244737.pdf) and [RHCE objectives](http://www.redhat.com/en/files/resources/en-rhtr-ex300-rhel-6-exam-objectives-0000000.pdf)) and ensure I study those items.

Please note, I've been using linux for 17 years.  I've managed multiple systems to hundreds of VMs.  I'll keep you posted on how it goes.

NB: I currently have Ubuntu as my native OS on my laptop, but am feeling out other distributions including [Linux Mint](http://www.linuxmint.com/) and [Fedora](https://getfedora.org/)
