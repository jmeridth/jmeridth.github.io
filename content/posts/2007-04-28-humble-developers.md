It's nice to know that developers of Oren's caliber can admit that they have "stupid" moments too.  I do the same thing.  I call them brain farts.

From his recent post:

"...Stuff happens, it is easy to forget a line of code and waste some time as a consequences. The most common sentence from me when I am developing is 'Oh, man, I am so stupid that I did that'." ([the post](http://ayende.com/Blog/archive/2007/04/28/A-developer-so-retarded.aspx))
