This may not be news to everyone, but [ReSharper now supports VB.NET](http://blogs.jetbrains.com/dotnet/2007/07/getting-started-with-resharper-30-and-vbnet-the-basics/).

Without starting a flame war about which language is better, I just want to let all the VB.NET developers out there that read this to understand that this tool is THE bomb.

I can't imagine coding C#/TDD without it.  It allows you to write your test first without the classes being implemented and then just typing Alt-Enter on the non-existant class, and it will auto-create it for you.

If you haven't checked it out, it is worth it.  It is the only tool in my arsenal that I was willing to use my own money.  It will pay you back 100 fold.
