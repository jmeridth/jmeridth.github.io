**[mbratton](#287 "2008-11-05 16:14:48"):** Pablo be praised!

**[jdn](#288 "2008-11-05 18:06:58"):** You're welcome. Thanks for the quick fix.

**[Jason Meridth](#289 "2008-11-05 18:11:42"):** @marcus Agreed @jdn Glad we got it out there for you. Let us know if we can help in any other ways.

**[Brad Mead](#290 "2008-11-05 19:54:10"):** Awesome enhancement guys. Thanks!

**[JoeTheDeveloper](#291 "2008-11-06 16:16:44"):** Jason, Still tinkering with the site, I presume? The front page is really really hard to read from user standpoint. It's now basically showing work history instead of 'real' information. Yeah, I *could* look at the RSS stuff or even use an RSS reader but I'm not that sophisticated yet... I do like the site :)

**[Jason Meridth](#292 "2008-11-06 16:21:53"):** @ Joe It's funny you mention that. We are working on a re-vamp of the home page. We have it in staging and will be moving it over soon. I may fix the home page to show blogs and media temporarily. Good input. Thanks.

**[Jason Meridth](#293 "2008-11-06 16:37:27"):** @JoeTheDeveloper I've changed the home page for now. We'll be putting up our custom one soon. Thanks for the input.
