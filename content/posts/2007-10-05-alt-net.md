UPDATE: Context: This was a joke!  No term was stated in a derogatory tone. [Howard Dierking](http://blogs.msdn.com/howard_dierking/default.aspx) does a much better job at [setting up the context and delivering the quote](http://blogs.msdn.com/howard_dierking/archive/2007/10/05/alt-net-conference-opening-day-opening-thoughts.aspx) than I did.  I apologize.

Scott Hanselman, "Mort is crying because mommy and daddy are fighting."

Hopefully we can find a solution.

This came from a fish bowl session that started the conference.

This is going to be an amazing weekend.
