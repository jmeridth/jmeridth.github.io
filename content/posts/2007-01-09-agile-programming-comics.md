The following comics are by Raj (Anil Hemrajani), the new author of [Agile Development with Spring, Hibernate and Eclipse](http://www.amazon.com/Development-Hibernate-Eclipse-Developers-Library/dp/0672328968).  The book is getting more good reviews than bad on Amazon, but seems to be lacking for more advance users.

However, the comics are still good.
