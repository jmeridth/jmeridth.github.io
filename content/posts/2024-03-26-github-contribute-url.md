**UPDATE:** I found out today that one of my colleague's [Justin Kenyon](https://github.com/kenyonj), a Staff Engineer at GitHub, was the author of this feature. Very cool I've been sharing this with many folks and learning he created it. 😄 Thank you for this feature Justin.

I sometimes get asked what is the best way to contribute to an open-source project.  If the project is hosted on GitHub, there is a helper URL for each repository that will highlight any issues that the maintainers have labelled with `good first issue` or `help wanted`.

that URL is `/contribute` on the the end of the repository URL.  For example, the URL for the `github.com/jmeridth/jmeridth.github.io` repository is <https://github.com/jmeridth/jmeridth.github.io/contribute>

You can search multiple repositories with GitHub's new <https://forgoodfirstissue.github.com/> website.  This site is a great way to find projects that are looking for help.

Happy contributing!
