"Even A**holes do great things" ~ (stated by Scott at the end of the ALT.net conference)

I agree with many others, a big thanks goes out to Scott and the other leaders of the ALT.net conference for putting it together.  It was weird being 1 of 100+ to "run" the conference. Open Spaces worked out really well.
