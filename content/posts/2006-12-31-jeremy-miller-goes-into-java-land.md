Jeremy Miller of CodeBetter.com recently [posted about his experiences with Java.](http://codebetter.com/blogs/jeremy.miller/archive/2006/12/30/Jeremy-in-Java-Land.aspx)

The references to Visual UnSafe (SourceSafe) and tdate libraries in Java are particularly hilarious.

I personally use [IntelliJ](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/) the same company that create ReSharper for .NET.  (an invaluable tool for C# developer by the way).
