I have landed a new gig at [GitHub](https://github.com).  I will be a Senior Software Engineer on the [GitHub OSPO (Open Source Program Office) team](https://github.blog/2023-03-13-an-open-source-project-to-empower-ospos-everywhere/).  I am super excited to be working with this team and this company.
