title: Creating an older rails project with multiple (newer) versions installed

I have been studying rspec the last week or two and have been using Rail 2.1.2 to do my exploring.Â  I was finally ready to jump into some legacy code and couldn't even create a spec folder on the directory tree because the version of rails was older:

```bash{linenos=table}
user$ ruby script/generate rspec
Cannot find gem for Rails ~>1.2.3.0:
    Install the missing gem with 'gem install -v=1.2.3 rails', or
    change environment.rb to define RAILS_GEM_VERSION with your desired version. 
```

After looking at the rails file in /usr/bin, I noticed the regex was looking for something that matched the following regex string:

```bash
/^_(.*)_$/
```

If my recollection holds, that means I'm looking for any character set that begins and ends with underscores (i.e., _1.x.x).

So I tried the following:

```bash
rails _1.2.3_ <projectname>
```

and it succeeded.

Hope this helps someone else. Continuing my Ruby journey.

I'm also looking at Fluent NHibernate now, so it's going to be a few couple weeks.
