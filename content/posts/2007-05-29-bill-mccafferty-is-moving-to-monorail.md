Bill McCafferty, the author of [NHibernate Best Practices on CodeProject](http://www.codeproject.com/aspnet/NHibernateBestPractices.asp), after researching many Separation of Concern Alternatives has decided to have his development team move to [Monorail](http://www.castleproject.org/monorail/index.html). ([read the post](http://devlicio.us/blogs/billy_mccafferty/archive/2007/05/29/concise-introduction-to-castle-monorail.aspx))

I'm curious to see how it goes.  I'd love for my current position to allow for such a migration but the time needed is not there right now.  Maybe someday.

Also, Hammet, the key contributor and found of the Castle project, has [posted on Castle View Components](http://www.google.com/reader/view/).  He links to Kevin Miller's blog [post about ASP.NET Controls vs. View Components](http://blogs.dovetailsoftware.com/blogs/kmiller/archive/2007/05/08/monorail-and-3rd-party-viewcomponents.aspx) (I'm mentioned in this post, redirecting Kevin to [JoeyDotNet's View Component posts](http://joeydotnet.com/blog/category/16.aspx) \- shameless plug).

I'm going to pursue more personal development time to MonoRail.

Hope everyone had a fun and safe Memorial Day weekend.
