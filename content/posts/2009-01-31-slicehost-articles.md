If you are Linux newbie or are still unsure about how to setup your **Linux** box/slice/server, take a serious look at the [Slicehost Articles](http://articles.slicehost.com/).  Other articles include setup of Apache, Nginx, Postfix, MySQL, Ruby on Rails, Capistrano, SSH, Self-signed certificates, Django, etc.  
  
For all the Only Windows guys who read this, these articles are a great way to get your feet wet with Linux.  Can't hurt your pocket book.  It's free. [Ubuntu](http://www.ubuntu.com) is currently my favorite distribution.  
  
I've [tweeted](http://www.twitter.com/armmer) about this a number of times.  
  
These articles are phenomenal.
