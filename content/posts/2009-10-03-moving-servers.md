To our readers,

We wanted to give you all a heads-up that we will be moving servers tomorrow evening, October 3rd, 2009.  We plan to turn off all comments at 8 PM CST.  The migration will begin at 9 PM CST.  We do not have an estimate on the time that the move will take.  We ask for your patience and look forward to being back to normal standing some time Sunday, October 4, 2009.

Again, we thank you for your patience.
