Well, it is a new year and I've started a new job.  I am now a Senior Software Engineer at [True Link Financial](https://truelinkfinancial.com).

After interviewing with the co-founders Kai and Claire and their team, I knew I wanted to work here.

**TL;DR**: True Link:  We give elderly and disable (really, anyone) back their financial freedom where they may not usually have it.

Longer Version:  Imagine you have an elderly family member who may start showing signs of dementia.  You can give them a True Link card and administer their card.  You link it to their bank account or another source of funding and you can set limitations on when, where and how the card can be used.  The family member feels freedom by not having to continually ask for money but is also protected by scammers and non-friendly people (yep, they exist).

The customer service team, the marketing team, the product team, the engineering team and everyone else at True Link are amazing.

For any nerd readers, the tech stack is currently Rails, React, AWS, Ansible.  We'll be introducing Docker and Kubernetes soon hopefully, but always ensuring the right tools for the right job.

Looking forward to 2018.

Cheers.
