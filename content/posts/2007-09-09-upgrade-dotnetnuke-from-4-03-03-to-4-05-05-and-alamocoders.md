I found this [post](http://www.mitchelsellers.com/Blogs/tabid/54/articleType/ArticleView/articleId/120/Upgrade-to-DotNetNuke-455-From-4x.aspx) and followed it to the "T" upgrading a DNN site to 4.5.5.  It worked perfectly.  Just trying to help get the word out if anyone else needs this information.

The site that I upgraded was [AlamoCoders](http://www.alamocoders.net/) (the local San Antonio .NET Users Group website).

If you are in the San Antonio area, our next meeting is Tuesday night.  Come check out my fellow LosTechies blogger, co-founder of Alamo Coders, and [Behave# (now a part of NBehave)](http://nbehave.org/) co-author, [Joe Ocampo](http://www.lostechies.com/blogs/joe_ocampo) (AgileJoe), speak about Test-Driven Development and [Behavior Driven Development](http://dannorth.net/introducing-bdd)
