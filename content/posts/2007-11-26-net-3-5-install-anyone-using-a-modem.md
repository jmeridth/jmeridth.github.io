"You can now disconnect form the Internet."

I don't know if you're using a modem, but I'm not.  Just thought this was funny.

**[Tony](#210 "2007-11-28 16:52:08"):** It's a little silly ... just knowing the download is complete is good enough. But you don't have to be using a modem. This situation occurs frequently enough being wireless nowadays. I often need to make sure my downloads are complete before I go out of wireless range with my laptop.
