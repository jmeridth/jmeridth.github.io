Wow!

I just left a presentation by Scott Guthrie on the new ASP.NET MVC architecture and I'm impressed.

His opening slide was:

Principles:
-Separation of concerns, unit testing, red/green TDD, maintainable
-Extensible and pluggable
-Enable clean urls and HTML
-Integrate nicely within ASP.NET + .NET core code, support static + dynamic languages

Jeffrey Palermo, has a great post on it in more detail [here](http://codebetter.com/blogs/jeffrey.palermo/archive/2007/10/05/altnetconf-scott-guthrie-announces-asp-net-mvc-framework-at-alt-net-conf.aspx).

EVERYTHING is interface based and goes through the controller/actions first.

IHttpRequest and IHttpResponse are completely mockable.

My daily summation is coming tonight.

Stay tuned.  I'm headed to the DDD session now.
