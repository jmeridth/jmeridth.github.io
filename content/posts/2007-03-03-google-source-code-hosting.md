If you don't want to host your own sourcecode on your own Subversion server like I was doing, check [this](http://code.google.com/hosting/) out.

It is Google's code hosting for subversion.  You are given 100 MB of space and can apply a specific open source licensing rule to your source.

Here are the currently allowed licenses.

Apache License 2.0  
Artistic License/GPLv2  
GNU General Public License 2.0  
GNU Lesser Public License  
MIT License  
Mozilla Public License 1.1  
New BSD License

I've already started a new project (more to come).
